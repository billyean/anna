You write 1 page to ram, when it fills up, you write it to disk. Then it empties, and fills again, after it fills it is written to disk after the previous page. If the buffer can hold 250 #s, then 200 will be from 4 pages, once 50 sorted numbers are written to the output buffer, it is saved to disk and cleared. Whenever an input buffer runs out of numbers, the next page is read in. Hope this helps.",2012-04-28 05:56:42.803000+00:00,10359854,1148705,,0
