<p>We believe in the power of community editing. That means once you've generated enough reputation, we trust you to edit <em>anything</em> in the system without it going through the peer review system. Not just your postsâ€”<em>anyone's posts!</em></p>

<h3>When should I edit posts?</h3>

<p>Any time you feel you can make the post better, and are inclined to do so. Editing is encouraged!</p>

<p>Some common reasons to edit are:</p>

<ul>
<li>to fix grammatical or spelling mistakes</li>
<li>to clarify the meaning of a post without changing it</li>
<li>to correct minor mistakes or add addendums / updates as the post ages</li>
<li>to add related resources or hyperlinks</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to make the post substantively better when you edit, not just change a single character. Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged.</p>

<h3>How do I edit posts?</h3>

<p>The <code>edit</code> link is available under each post.</p>

<h3>What happens when I edit a post?</h3>

<p>The post will be updated to show the latest editor, as well as the original author. All edits are saved and tracked in a revision history with attribution to each editor. </p>

<p>The revision history can be viewed by clicking the date and time next to the edited post (e.g. ""edited 3 days ago"").</p>

<p>Editing a post also bumps the question to the top of the homepage. Too many edits can also force a post into <a href=""/privileges/community-wiki"">community wiki mode</a>. Make your edits count.</p>

<h3>Reviewing suggested edits</h3>

<p>In addition, users with this privilege level also get access to the suggested edits queue. The queue has a list of posts which have been edited upon by users who don't have edit privileges. This queue can be accessed over at the <a href=""/review/suggested-edits"">suggested edits tab in the review section</a>.<br>
Users with this privilege level get access to the <a href=""/review/low-quality-posts"">Low Quality Posts</a> list where they can improve the low quality posts, or suggest they are deleted.</p>",0,,2013-02-27 12:13:24.423000+00:00,2013-02-27 12:13:24.423000+00:00,2013-02-27 12:13:24.423000+00:00,,1583,,-1,8,1,

<p>A tag is a keyword or label that categorizes your question with other, similar questions. When you retag a question, you're correcting the existing tags on the question. </p>

<p>When you receive this privilege you get the ability to retag posts without having to go through the peer review system (this applied to edits that change tags and <em>nothing else</em>). When you reach 2000 reputation <a href=""/privileges/edit"">all of your edits will bypass the peer review system</a>.</p>

<h3>When should I retag a question?</h3>

<p>Questions should be tagged correctly so others can more easily find them and answer them. Retag when a community member has:</p>

<ul>
<li>chosen incorrect tags that don't properly represent the actual question topic</li>
<li>added excess, superfluous tags</li>
<li>created an inappropriate new tag</li>
<li>made a mistake with tags, such as using spaces instead of hyphens</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I retag a question?</h3>

<p>Click the <code>edit</code> menu option under the post and add/remove tags.</p>

<h3>What badges can I earn?</h3>

<p>When you retag a post for the first time, you will earn the Organizer badge:</p>
