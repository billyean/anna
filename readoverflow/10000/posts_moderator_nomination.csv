You feel pride at being able to say you once shook a senator’s hand, or saw the President in person. Ah, yes, the grand deity himself, His Royal Highness, the President of the United States of America.
You speak the title as if you’re referring to God Almighty. The vocabulary has changed a bit, but your mindset is no different from that of the groveling peasants of old who bowed low, faces in the dirt, with a feeling of unworthiness and humility, when in the presence of whatever narcissist had declared himself to be their rightful lord and master. The truth of the matter, back then and today, is that these parasites who call themselves ‘leaders’ are not superior beings, they are not great men and women, they are not honorable, they’re not even average.</p>

I may not be one of the original users, or one of the reputation stars, or stand out from the crowd in any particular way... But I'm here and I'm contributing and I want to do what I can to help where I can.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow has provided me with help on countless occasions.  I haven't asked many questions because at least 3/4 of the time the question I have has already been asked and answered.  There is a wealth of content here and it's growing every day.  Given everything I've received from this website, I want to help keep it going.  I want to help maintain the standards that make this community so great.</p>

We all make mistakes, and I'm no exception to that.)  All of it together represents who I am and how I contribute to this community.</p>

<p>My reputation graph seems to reflect the time I spend on this site in the fact that there are months where I'm here constantly and there are months where I barely contribute.  My professional life sometimes keeps me away from this community, but I'm never so far as to not help out in some way.  Even on days when I can't find the questions to answer or the time to answer them, I'm still here browsing the content.  Learning from others, helping to moderate (voting to close or migrate, leaving hopefully helpful comments on questions for which I don't otherwise have an answer, and so on), sometimes just bumming around and looking for a way to contribute.</p>

<p>Between the wonderful content which has helped me on countless occasions, the content I've provided which has helped me grow as a developer, the members of the community with whom I've interacted, and even the wonderful job I landed through Stack Overflow Careers...

<h2>Enough about that, let's focus on what you care about:</h2>

<p><strong>Why does someone want to volunteer to be a mod?</strong></p>

<p>Surely the person who <em>volunteers</em> for a public-good task is probably the least suited for the job, yeah? </p>

<p>That would be true if I were asking to be a SOIS - Community Senator or something, but I'm really just looking to be a better janitor. I already flag questions for close, suggest comments on how to make other questions better, edit titles/tags/questions, and generally help with the upkeep. But I would be happy to take that one step further and help a little more, because I believe in SOIS and the mission to make the internet a better place.</p>

<p>Of course, I also realize that I could just be some power hungry guy looking to make a name for himself as a ruthless mod, exacting bloody vengeance throughout the community as tho I were the grim reaper and my mod abilities were my scythe. But with Jeff on the horizon, I doubt anyone could pull that stunt at this point, even if they were so inclined. So no, I don't want to be a <em>god mod</em>, I just want to help keep the SO community in good general repair, and help out as I can.</p>",0,2011-01-18 23:02:43.190000+00:00,2011-01-18 23:02:43.190000+00:00,2011-01-18 23:02:43.190000+00:00,2011-01-18 23:02:43.190000+00:00,,109749,,109749,6,0,

I've spent enough time on other sites to know why SO is so special and how it truly excels. Stackoverflow has been one of the greatest things that has happened to the programming world in the past two years, and its been of a massive help to so many people.</p>

<p>However, I know there is always room for improvement, and with a community this powerful and dedicated, anything is possible. I came here a total beginner, and although I still have a long way to go, I've seen so many unique aspects of SO on my journey through programming. There's truly no other site where people can have fun, learn, and teach and have fun while talking about the subject they truly love like stackoverflow. This site is something special that happens once in a lifetime, and I want to do everything I can to make it the best place it can be.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time on meta, the blog, and area51, and I want to be there for every step stackoverflow takes so I can be of as much of a help as possible, either as a moderator, teacher, or just a plain participator in the community. All of them are great honors that I am happy to have. I know what the site looks like from a total beginner's point of view because I sort of grew up here. I know how people feel to get downvoted for bad posts, how it feels to get questions closed, and how it feels when somebody greets you with a smile and takes time to try to help you understand. </p>

<p>Moderation is not about the posts, its about the people who will make and read the posts. Its a moderator's responsibility to educate other users about the site and help them understand how things work. The buttons granted to you represent the people's trust in you to control their experience. Making that experience as good as possible is <em>always</em> your goal. Hence, moderation should be done as lightly as possible, and the community should be able to weigh in as much as possible on moderator decisions. Comments that explain what you are thinking about doing and why are vital for both the poster and the viewer, because they ultimately educate the community and make sure that you are doing what they want and helping them as much as possible, and only with the community's feedback can I know if I'm doing my job correctly.</p>

<p>My journey on SO began in Dec 2009. While working on a hobby project I was looking for ways
to parse HTML. I posted my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/1881237/227665"">first question</a> asking how to use regex to parse and extract from HTML :) One of the comments had a link to the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454"">all time famous answer of why not to parse HTML using
regex</a>. I spent the entire evening reading it and other top Q&amp;A. That day sort
of triggered a programming knowledge chain reaction which is going on
till today. SO is certainly one of the best things that has happened to
programming and programmers.</p>

<p>I've been around here for just over a year now. I've learnt a lot of things from this site and it's time to give something back to the community.</p>

<p>I think I've made good use of the moderator tools currently available
to me. You can see me re-tagging, re-framing, formatting, migrating questions whenever I'm online. My special focus being on new users who are not quite aware of how the site functions.
I'll be honored to have the added responsibility of a moderator.</p>

<p>Some things about me you'd like to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>I visit the site almost everyday.</li>
<li>I know the site inside out.</li>
<li>I spend a lot of time reading old
posts and improving them if necessary.</li>
<li>I'm active across decent number of tags.</li>
<li>I've Electorate, Copy Editor,
Fanatic, Sportsmanship, Pundit and
Generalist badges.<br>Gold badge in C, PHP, C++, Java and Regex and Silver badge in Perl.</li>
<li>I visit meta frequently and have read almost all discussions going on there but
I've not actively participated in meta Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>Available mostly between 0900hrs to 1900hrs

8042241,"<p>I'd like to nominate myself for StackOverflow moderator. I am very active in the community -- mostly within the C# and general .NET tags -- and frequently help moderate questions and answers (either by improving them if possible or voting to close/delete or flagging) using the 10k+ user tools, but I feel like I would be a helpful addition to the formal moderating team.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>I've been a member of StackOverflow for more than two and a half years. In that time, I've committed myself to making SO a better site, and my interaction has (hopefully) been in line with that goal. </p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<ul>
<li>I have a good handle on grammar and punctuation (son of an English teacher; sue me), and I try to give a helping hand to questions where the meaning is clear with some effort, but language issues might prevent them from getting the high-quality answers they deserve.</li>
<li>I am available during the peak StackOverflow hours (the workday in the western hemisphere) and frequently answer and moderate questions during this time.</li>
<li>I have experience with other forms of internet moderation (e.g. forum moderator, panel discussion facilitator, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderation Policy</h2>

<p>While personally no stranger to the close vote (or delete vote when it's warranted), I tend to be fairly inclusive when it comes to the questions that I come across. Questions that are blatantly too broad (asking for someone to write a complete application, for example) I'll generally close--especially if they come from someone who's been around the block and should know better--but I'll also try to help the user either define what their question actually <em>is</em> or give a couple of suggestions to get them started so that they can come back with a specific technical question.</p>

<p>I think that moderation should take the long view; after all, the purpose of StackOverflow is to provide the internets with a resource for <em>finding solutions</em>, not necessarily asking questions. To that end, I generally tailor my moderation practices to favor questions that have a lasting, broad appeal, or those that strike a good balance between specificity and generality. With that said, I still personally try to help users (or at least point them in the right direction) even if their question isn't well suited to the site.</p>

<h2>So...now what?</h2>

<p>If you've taken the time to read my nomination, then thank you! I'm guessing, though, that I haven't answered all of your questions. If so (or even if not), please come to <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule"">one of the scheduled Town Hall meetings</a> and ask away; I'm currently scheduled to attend the first meeting (Tuesday, 11/15/2011 at 9:00pm Eastern), but I will make every effort to attend the second meeting as well, assuming that work obligations allow for it.</p>

<p>I log onto Stack Overflow a few times a day, and am happy to spend some of that time on the few bits of moderation the community doesn't naturally take care of. I get a lot out of Stack Overflow and since I'm not a Skeet-level expert on any topic and can't always give amazing answers, this seems like a good way to bolster my contribution to the site.</p>

<p>I believe in the original goal of Stack Overflow to be the place for canonical answers on programming topics. I believe in the wiki-like, editable nature of it that means almost any one visit to the site offers the opportunity to leave it a slightly better place than you found it.</p>

<p>I believe in an upvote where it's deserved (occasionally <em>all</em> the answers on a question deserve an upvote...), a downvote where it's deserved (as long as an appropriate comment with some corrective advice goes with it), and the difference between posting an answer that isn't an answer vs. posting a comment.</p>

<p>A good community that's built on a good site can never be a bad thing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hello, I'm Michael and <strong>I love Stack Overflow</strong>.</p>

<p>I've been a web developer for well over a decade. The web is dynamic and always evolving. Because of that, Stack Overflow holds a special place in my heart as a place to teach and learn.</p>

<p>While my initial goals on Stack Overflow were to grow as a developer, I have also evolved. The time I spend here now revolves around improving content. My philosophy is that <em>a question that is well organized and concise attracts more quality answers</em>. Furthermore, the benefits progress how our questions are indexed by search engines.</p>

<p>One area which I believe needs a lot of love is tagging. I want to be more hands-on in SO's taxonomy, helping to bring content into the eyes of the subject matter experts. Content is only as good as it is accessible.</p>

<p>Numbers can tell a story, but I don't put much weight in them. I'm here to help, not get the high score. If you're interested in how I've contributed over the past 5 years, please <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/542517/michael-irigoyen"">visit my profile</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone! There are a lot of outstanding members in the community who continue to make SO the best professional Q&amp;A site!</p>",3,2015-04-06 22:24:17.487000+00:00,2015-04-06 22:24:17.487000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:35:00.430000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:35:00.430000+00:00,,811,,542517,6,724,

<p>Vote for me, I'm willing to sweep the floors and keep on top of the flags queue. I'm also prepared to deal with the requests to <em>""plz merge my old Jon Skeet account with my new account, honestly it is my account""</em> and to clean up duplicate answers that have been sprayed around on vaguely related questions by new users.  </p>

<p>I know the life of a moderator is not just about glamour and hanging out with the groupies, it requires continuous work to keep the site tidy. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/109702/slugster?tab=activity"">Check out my activity</a> - you will see that I am continuously doing a lot of the housekeeping type work that could be expected from a moderator, it has earned me the <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/2042/users-eligible-for-2011-stack-overflow-moderator-elections"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>four badges</strong></a> mandatory for selection.</p>

<p>Also note my 700+ flag weight. What this bit of information <strong>really</strong> means is that not only do I do a reasonable volume of work, that work is of a good quality. What doesn't show directly in that flag weight is the number of questions that I have tidied up or voted on as a result of reviewing those flags. I'm active with <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/146015/slugster"">suggestions and questions on Meta</a>, and my answers to the questions <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/106321/etiquette-for-flagging-a-high-rep-users-old-answer-as-not-an-answer/106352#106352""><em>Etiquette for flagging a high rep user's old answer as Not an Answer</em></a> and <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/98947/should-my-answer-be-more-succinct-or-more-verbose/98951#98951""><em>Should my answer be more succinct or more verbose?</em></a> give an insight into how I handle and think about things.</p>

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong> In real life I am a senior level professional developer (i.e. I have been in the game a long time, lectured at TechEd, etc.), so I have a nose for sniffing out crap in questions and answers. I have previously moderated on other forums, dealing with the h4x0rs and crackers in the open discussion area on masmforum.com certainly helps build a thick skin and no nonsense approach. I am located in the bottom end of the world (new Zealand, not far from Australia), in a timezone that is nicely offset from the UK and USA, which means I can catch questions and clean-up while others are sleeping.</p>

<p>If you want to know how I roll, check out my answers in the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112443/november-2011-moderator-election-town-hall-chat-digest-1"">Town Hall Chat Digest #1</a>. Due to work commitments I wasn't able to attend the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112538/november-2011-moderator-election-town-hall-chat-digest-2"">Town Hall Chat Digest #2</a> until near the end, so I just cherry picked some questions from that one to answer.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<h2>My agenda</h2>

<p>Let's face it, I don't want to become a moderator simply to get god like powers and that little diamond beside my moniker. I also have a couple of things I would like to achieve:  </p>

<ul>
<li>to really get the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108579/canonical-answers-for-repeated-questions"">canonical answer concept</a> going. There are some answers that really are so good that they should be recognised as THE answer, and subsequent duplicate questions should be pointed back to that original answer. Imagine if <strong>you</strong> get recognised as the author of one of these canonical answers! Once this gets traction I can see it improving the answer quality markedly as people strive to attain this.</li>
<li>There are a lot of old <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107712/old-best-book-resource-questions""><em>""What is the best ...""</em></a> type questions - many of these have limited relevance one or two years on, but some of them still have some value. These need to be rationalised, the goods ones kept and the bad ones 'cancelled'. </li>
</ul>

<p>These are goals that will take some time (and co-operation from fellow moderators and SO'ers) to achieve.</p>

<p>Due to the amount of time I already spend on the site over the day, being a moderator on Stack Overflow is not going to require any extra effort on my part, it will simply enable me to do a more comprehensive job than what I'm currently able to do. In addition to the current flow of work there is still a lot to be done cleaning up historical questions, and having moderator privileges will assist with that.

8044210,"<p>I believe I'd make a fair and useful moderator for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Time: I currently use Stack Overflow to fill what would otherwise be idle time. This typically replaces ""reading the news"" whilst eating breakfast/lunch, the 5-10 minutes whilst building/testing some new code. Stack Overflow filled a newsgroup sized hole in my habits when my local NNTP server got pulled because nobody else was using it any more! My usual time-zone is GMT/BST.</p></li>
<li><p>Active: I'm fairly active in the C++ and C++11 tags, although by no means the most active in either. As well as that I regularly look over the ""late answers to old questions"" list, looking for answers that need editing or look suspicious in some way (e.g. spam/sockpuppets). I have some experience in a number of other tags too, as well as basic sysadmin experience which I've used to raise flags to prevent inappropriate migrations to Server Fault in particular.</p></li>
<li><p>Badges: I have the requisite badges (and actually the gold equivalents of the silver ones too). I actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge I'm able to flag the problem posts that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful, but occasionally get disputed; which I avoided before getting the badges. I mostly like doing things because they're useful. Badges were a distraction from that, moderator access would increase the number of useful actions available.</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness: I feel I know my limitations. I'm fairly good at knowing when and where I should seek further advice. As an example one of the first things I did after getting access to the 10K tools was ask about how best to handle several borderline cases on chat and read a lot of meta posts about the 10K tools. I've also raised quite a few flags that ran along the lines of ""there are several problems here, (list of problems) - I'm not sure how best to proceed"" and then observed the action taken by moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>Fair and objective: In my view all of my actions to date on this site (and others on the network) have been objective and fair. I'm able to recognise the danger signs of losing that objectivity and step back to allow someone else to handle that and avoid escalating a situation into a conflict. In the past that's been through flagging (and a keen watch to see the result). As a moderator that would be walking away to let someone else handle it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Summary: I feel like I've seen how things work around here, I have time to offer and I'd like access to the moderator tools to convert my time into direct actions rather than simply adding them to somebody else's list of tasks.</p>",3,2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000+00:00,2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000+00:00,2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000+00:00,2011-11-07 23:36:40.853000+00:00,,168175,,168175,6,250,

<h2>Stances on moderation</h2>

<p>In case you can't make it to the <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule"">next two town hall chats for the candidates</a>, I figured I'd answer some of the <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=stars"">most popular questions posed to candidates at the last town hall chat for election</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288947#288947"">A diamond will be attached to <em>everything</em> you say, including
  questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen

</blockquote>

<p>I've been a Microsoft MVP for over ten years; one of the tenants of the award is professionalism, and our activities in the peer-to-peer space are monitored to see if we maintain that professionalism.  </p>

<p>I've been under the microscope for a long time, and I've not expected that to end anytime soon.  It's natural for me; common courtesy and professionalism are always integral to how I approach anything, whether on SO or elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288820#288820"">Based on your observations of current SO diamond moderators and
  Meta.SO and thus diamond moderation policy, how long do you think it

<p>To <a href=""http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/334.html"" rel=""nofollow"">quote Albert Einstein</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously though, there <em>will</em> be a learning curve, and I will be aggressive in ""getting over the hump"" as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In that time, however, I will approach issues I am unsure about the way I would any other, collaborating with my peers, learning in the process, and abstaining until I am convinced that the course of action is the best one for the community.</p>

<p>If I had to put a hard number on it, I'd say somewhere between one to two months (that might be a little aggressive, but I've yet to experience the full breadth and width of what I'll have to pick up).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288749#288749"">Would you suspend a user who repeatedly posts replies to their
  questions in answers instead of comments who has been told of the
  proper procedure, and if so, for how long? If not, what action would
  you take instead, if any?</a> - <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/89334/waiwai933"">waiwai993</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the user's intent; if it's clear that the user is flagrantly disregarding proper procedure in the face of being politely told otherwise, then yes, I would suspend a user.  How long would be dependent on the user's activity, it would have to be a period long enough to have an impact.</p>

<p>Suspending a user for a day when they come to the site once every two weeks will have little effect.</p>

<p>If I cannot find any information that the user has been informed of the proper procedure then I will do so in the comments, suggesting that the user add it as a comment.  I'd then monitor the user's behavior for a little bit, and inform my fellow moderators about that user's activities.</p>

<p>I like to help. It's why I was awarded an MVP position (another tenant, helping others in a peer-to-peer environment).  It's why I created <a href=""http://sf4answers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sf4answers</a>.</p>

<p>The more ability I am given to help individuals or groups as a whole, I take.  Being a moderator will allow me to bring a better SO experience to all and I'd take it as a source of pride to be able to say I helped do that in some small way.</p>

<p>And I like diamonds. =)</p>

  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288915#288915"">Do you think it's the role of the moderator to calm down

</blockquote>

<p>If it is a singular comment/answer, etc, then it might be able to be easily defused by a polite comment, and it takes little time to do that.  While one might be a moderator, that doesn't mean that one should bring the sledgehammer down when a regular hammer will do.</p>

<p>If it's a full-blown comment war, then no, it's not the role of moderator to calm down these situations, <strong>it's the role of the moderator to stop/fix them with the tools given to them</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, it should be said that the SO community does a great job of policing these things themselves with flags, something that helps all moderators.  I believe in the flagging policy and the community's use of it.</p>

<p>It's exactly this reason that <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/140951/casperone?tab=activity"">I'm to engaging more in meta</a> (<a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111663/have-better-description-of-moderator-election-nomination-on-activity-tab"">sometimes sucessfully</a>, <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111529/allow-moderators-to-remove-accepted-flags-on-blatantly-incorrect-answers"">sometimes not so much</a>), without that contribution, I won't be able to do my job as moderator effectively; contributing in meta more will only help me with getting over the hump mentioned above.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There's little context around this, but low-quality posts degrade the system, and that is a bad thing.  Low-quality posts would be deleted.  Of course, ones which are debatable in quality would be discussed with fellow moderators and the community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288766#288766"">Related question: How would you deal with a user who produced a

</blockquote>

<p>I'd defer them all to Shog9 ;)</p>

<p>I think this case is simple, you don't deal with the user, you deal with the comments through moderation.  </p>

<p>If the user's overall net effect is negative (and extremely negative at that) <em>then you deal with the user</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't consider myself addicted, but that's a subjective view.  My wife might consider otherwise. =)</p>

<p>Good ways are obvious; I get to contribute and help others, and I get to learn in the process.  That satisfies a core part of who I am.  </p>

<p>The bad ways?  Well, I joked about my wife earlier, but there are times I'm trying to put that finishing touch on an edit and it's not the most opportune time, and I might put off other things at times to do such things, but generally I can't say my life is out of balance because of it.  </p>

<p>SO has been very good to me, and I want to be very good to it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't mind at all, the community has so many available to them and it's been shown that they can put them to good use.  I'll have other more prominent concerns to address as moderator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288907#288907"">Since @MichaelMrozek mentioned burnout, how can you avoid getting

  <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/181481/rebecca-chernoff"">Rebecca</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communication is key; no moderator is an island.</p>

<p>Keep up the lines of communication; if the communication is starting to wane from generally accepted levels, then that might be the first indicator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288896#288896"">Question: When should questions be closed and just left alone vs.
  when should they be closed and deleted? That is, when do you believe
  in deleting content?</a> - <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/19679/brad-larson"">Brad Larson</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've already stated that if the content is of very low quality, then it should be deleted.  If the content is offensive or hateful in any way, it should be deleted.</p>

<p>However, there are a good number of times where the question might have a better life on another SE site, or if it is of questionably low quality, a nudge (in the form of a comment) can encourage a user to turn low-quality content into good content.</p>

<p>Deleting should be aggressive when the content is of an obviously detrimental nature to SO and the community; other means should be used when it is not.</p>

<p>There are more questions, but I really like and want to answer this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288881#288881"">PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY QUESTION: Ability to edit other people's answers
  - great SO feature, or greatest SO feature?</a> - <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/811/shog9"">Shog9</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>is</em> a great feature, but it is not SO's <em>greatest</em> feature, IMO.  The vote is SO's greatest feature; so much of what is done on SO is predicated on the vote, it opens/closes gateways to so many other features which serve to encourage the community to help keep the system running in a healthy manner.</p>

<p>I love that we can edit posts and take great pride in doing it (as I've done it quite often), but to me, the vote and all that it enables is the single greatest feature of SO (IMO).</p>

<hr/>

<h2>General Philosophy</h2>

<p>This election, I didn't just ""throw my hat into the ring"", that was what I did the last time I nominated myself, not approaching it with the seriousness it deserves.  </p>

<p>Since then, there's been time to reflect on the position, and as to whether or not I truly want it.  My answer is a resounding ""yes"".  This time, I approach the election and the position with a seriousness, passion, and commitment that the position demands.</p>

<p>Reputation is important.  It's the quantifiable cornerstone of what Stack Overflow is built on.</p>

<p>The pursuit of reputation, however is not important.  What is of more importance are the actions one takes to foster the community in a positive direction (one of the reasons for the badge requirements, I gather, which I fully support).</p>

<p>That said, I've long been an advocate of improving the quality of the experience for <em>everyone</em> at SO; editing posts for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting code for readability, voting to close/migrate posts, flagging posts (<em>never</em> out of spite or malice, but always with the goal of improving the overall quality of the question and/or system).</p>

<p>These are things that there are no (or difficult to acquire) metrics for.  They are tedious and thankless, and yet still must be done in order to keep the quality bar high.</p>

<p>These are the tasks that I take joy in providing, knowing that the actions I take based on the care I have for a better experience have a real, lasting effect.</p>

<p>I am a passionate believer in the neutrality that a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/faq#editing"">collaborative, wiki-like site such as Stack Overflow</a> strives to maintain.  I believe in this so much so that I've <strong>never</strong> had a problem <strong>voting/flagging my own content for removal</strong> in order to improve the overall quality.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Why I believe I should be one of your next moderators</h2>

<p>I've never asked nor expected thanks.  This is why being a moderator is perfect for me.  I revel in the tasks that I know must be done (just look at my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/50776/casperone?tab=reputation#page_1-view_graph"">reputation gain over the last year vs. the past two years</a>); the work is it's own reward.  </p>

<p>Being a moderator is allows me to do more of this work and on a greater scale.  It enables me to do what I love and provide for a better user experience for all.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about helping.  As a creator of a <a href=""http://sf4answers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Stack Overflow clone</a>, I've been able to combine my passion for technology and for helping others.</p>

<p>I'll bring that same passion to the moderator role when elected.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Q&A</h2>

<p>Come to <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule"">next the town hall meeting (or two!) for moderator election nominees</a>, and ask ask ask!</p>

<p>That's up to you!  Be aggressive and <strong>ask the questions in the comments that are important to you in the comments</strong>.</p>

<p>Ask the things <strong>you feel you must know about your candidate</strong> that will guide your decision in this election.</p>

<p>I'll answer <strong>everything</strong> with the same transparency that I will bring to my actions as a moderator.</p>

4729762,"<p>I would like to become a moderator due to the fact that I'm very socially active as well as great patience. </p>

<p>Working for a organisation that demands patience as a key skill, over the years I have become very good at listening to all parties arguments and deciding not the facts that are in front of me, I am not the type to be socially persuaded into a decision. </p>

<p>I believe in myself that my listening skills are good in comparison to many other members of stack overflow members. </p>

<p>Some details about myself: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name: Robert Pitt </li>
<li>Age: 22 </li>
<li>Some Skills: Programming, Networking, Infrastructure, Problem Solving, Team Management </li>
<li>Interests: Computer Science, Programming, Latest Technologies, Sports, Pint in the pub, Enjoying Life, Socialising. </li>
</ul>

<p>A short Biography: 
I'm a young enthusiastic person who thrives on becoming great at anything I find interesting, I work for the Children's Services across the UK where I work with Information Communication Technology as a Manager for the Infrastructure and Innovations team. </p>

<p>But under all that I'm actually a relaxed guy who likes to be with mates, going to the pub and talking about Music, Life, Women etc.</p>

<p>Something you may notice about my profile is that i have several answers with 0 votes, several answers with minus votes, I would just like you to know that this is not down to poor answers (although sometimes when I'm tired I can make mistakes) but the fact that even though I'm incorrect I leave my answers up where others would delete them if they start getting down votes.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that SO is not about reputation, Its not about being right all the time, its about providing the less knowledgeable with a set of answers that are marked accordingly to there correctness, so that the user knows what's correct <em>as well</em> as what's incorrect. </p>

<p>On SO there is only need for little intervention when when it comes to moderation and knowing when that intervention should be is a key factor in keeping peace within the community.</p>

<p>From the past sites that I have run as well as moderated I have learnt that moderators need to be considerate as well as vigilant, Within my life I have been known to be able to talk any single person and be able to read there character and personality and respond with the correct tone,manner and body language to be able to keep a certain level of respect.</p>

<p>I believe that bringing some of these skills into the community I would be able to gain respect and order from the community.</p>

<p>Finally I would just like to say that I'me not perfect, and if you expected the perfect moderator I would withdraw my proposal, I expect to make mistakes and I look forward to making mistakes as this is the only true way to gain experience and knowledge.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to review this post. </p>

<p>Hello world!  My name is Rocket (not really).  I've been a member of StackOverflow for almost 1.25 years.  I used to work as a Computer Science tutor in college, so I like to help people.  I currently work full time as a PHP/jQuery programmer.  Throughout my busy day at work, I am always on StackOverflow helping people where and when I can.</p>

<p>The community here has helped me with a lot of my programming projects and I love helping others.</p>

<p>I hate when you have a problem, so you Google it and the only thing you find is a forum post you made asking how to fix it.  I first found this site by Googling a Java problem I was having, and there were plenty of solutions.  I signed up to comment on the answer, and I immediately found myself wanting to answer others questions.</p>

<p>I am that guy who will keep staring at a file until that one little bug is fixed.  I can't remember the last time I left work when I'm supposed to.</p>

<p>I am aware that I don't have much of a presence on Meta, but I am always editing questions and answers to improve grammar and readability.  I also make sure to re-tag questions where I see fit.  If I see you using bad grammar or forgetting to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> code blocks, I'll go ahead and fix that.</p>

<li><p>Moderate in moderation, with a light touch but a firm hand, with patience, respect and fairness.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever possible, let the community make its own decisions, using the tools available to them, such as voting and closing.  Step in only when this self-moderation process fails.</p></li>

<p>I have been a member for the last 1 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> years, so i've got a good feel for the SO flow.</p>

<p>For me moderation is NOT about spending endless hours on SO editing posts, removing tags from post titles and reminding tardy users about 0% accept rates (i already do that).

I'm also in the timezone that is first to see the sunrise everyday, so like a ninja i'm around to action things when everyone else is asleep.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <br/>
my usage of the word 'damn' has drawn some comment, but it brings up a very interesting point: <strong>culture</strong>. It is important to remember that Stack Overflow has participants from many different cultures - not so that we can be politically correct, but so that we can <em>recognise something when said inadvertantly or taken out of its intended context</em>.</p>

<p>I used the word <em>damn</em> in a light hearted, informal, self-deprecating manner, which is culturally 100% legitimate where i come from.

<p>Hi all. I'm hichris123, a student who is <em>not</em> a pink gravatar in real life.</p>

Granted, MF gets only a fraction of the action SO gets, but it's been a nice primer in how to moderate.</p>

<p>I work for a Fortune 500 company, cut my teeth on MSAccess (where you'll find me a good portion of the time answering questions) and along the way learned a bit about html, asp, C# (where you'll find me a good portion of the time <strong>asking</strong> questions) and several other technologies.</p>

<p>I'm an avid music fan, sports fan, and love tinkering around with code.  And I enjoy sharing the knowledge I've gained, because everyone at some point is a n00b.  I think that part of my personality is what would make me a good moderator here, because moderating is not just cleaning up typos and flagging bad comments.  It's also being judicial, and knowing when to use a bit of diplomacy to make someone's experience more pleasant.  In the end, we want to expand the user base and maintain a high standard for incoming questions, and the more people enjoy their experience here the easier it will be to achieve those goals.</p>",8,2015-11-13 21:13:17.850000+00:00,2015-11-13 21:13:17.850000+00:00,2015-11-13 21:13:17.850000+00:00,2015-11-13 21:13:17.850000+00:00,,2174085,,2174085,6,440,
8045148,"<p>I was excited when Stack Overflow was first announced. I wasn't a regular reader of Coding Horror or Joel on Software. In fact, I slightly distrusted both of them for using Microsoft products<sup>1</sup>. But they both seemed competent <em>enough</em> to save us from the evils of Experts-Exchange, and I joined for the private beta (with user id 1114).</p>

<p>When the site launched I recommended it to everybody. I was happy with the site overall; I participated occasionally and made a few posts on UserVoice, but many of Joel and Jeff's decisions irritated me. They seemed arbitrary and bizarre, and reinforced my existing negative impressions of them.</p>

<p>A few years later (~six months ago) I <em>finally</em> ended up listening to an episode of the podcast. I can't remember why, it was probably recommended by some meta thread. As I listened, I was surprised. They actually sounded quite reasonable! I listened to more of the archive, and more, and then started reading old meta threads.</p>

<p>All of a sudden old decisions that had seemed random began to make sense. As I started to appreciate the philosophy of Stack Overflow I became more excited about the site and <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/users/851?tab=reputation"">my participation increased dramatically</a>. I had been transformed from an occasional user into a <strong>Fanatic</strong>! ;-)</p>

<p>Since then, I've been very active on Stack Overflow and Meta, picking up <strong>Electorate</strong> on both sites. Most of the answers I've contributed have been in <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a>, for which I have silver badges, though I also browse many tags I'm inexperienced with to learn about them. I've spent a while reviewing and searching through old posts and have the <strong>Marshal</strong> badge for reaching 749 flag weight. It would be very satisfying to be able to act directly instead of just creating work for others.</p>

<p>I do my best to consider the site's philosophy and the community's consensus while editing. I don't have any <em>unique</em> plans for how I'd behave as a moderator; there's a lot of work to be done and I think I have the time, enthusiasm and competence to help. As a moderator, when I'm not sure how the community feels about an issue I'll look for and read previous meta discussions before taking action.</p>

<p>As a last point, I have <strong>Publicist</strong> on Stack Overflow and <strong>Announcer</strong> on several smaller Stack Exchange sites, accounting for tens of thousands of visits. I don't have much expertise to contribute on other Stack Exchange sites, so I try to contribute in ways like this.</p>

<h2>Self-nomination</h2>

<p>Hello Stack Overflow! I'd like to nominate myself as a candidate in this upcoming moderator election.</p>

<p>The key part of being a moderator here is having good judgement, and I think that's something I do have. I've got a flag weight of <s>almost</s> over 600 (which would be more if I flagged questions instead of closing them manually since I got that privilege) and only around 4 flags that have been deemed invalid (hopefully) showing that I know what belongs where here, when to close or to migrate, or what's rude, harassment, or spam. I've come across many things before that don't belong on Stack Overflow and should be deleted, and I could definitely help manage the abundance of poorly written or unconstructive items instead of having to delegate it to moderators.</p>

<p>Please don't let my age deter anybody. I can assure you that I'm just as mature as anyone else. Sometimes more so =)</p>

<p>So... vote minitech! I'll delete stuff and edit and close it and whatnot.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Self-promotion!!!</h2>

<p>If you think reputation and time spent here and things like that aren't important, don't read this section. Otherwise, please continue. =)</p>

<p>I've been on Stack Overflow for less than a year (a little over 7 months) but I've already hit the 10k mark for reputation.

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Hi, I'm John. On SO I've mainly been active in <a href=""/questions/tagged/r"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;r&#39;"" rel=""tag"">r</a>. I'm a postdoc/lecturer at MIT, got my PhD from MIT in operations research, and got my undergrad from Maryland in math and computer science.</p>

<h3>Why I'm Running</h3>

<p>I'm the sort of person who is drawn to cleaning up messes; for instance, when I worked for a newspaper I was copy desk chief. On SO I find janitorial work rewarding and spend most of my time moderating. As a diamond mod I could expand the reach and impact of my moderation by addressing the range of issues raised through the flag queue.</p>

<h3>Why Pick Me</h3>

<p>I think I have a few characteristics of a good diamond mod:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Volume</strong>: I'm on the site a lot (much more than 30 minutes/day) and moderate at high volume (e.g. 8.6k helpful flags, 7.5k on Q+A). I think I could help knock down the size of the flag queue.</li>
<li><strong>Light Touch</strong>: I take care when moderating to avoid deleting useful content (e.g. 267 helpful flags per declined/disputed). I would apply the same light touch as a diamond moderator, only stepping in when necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Moderating with Respect</strong>: I try to be respectful and understanding in moderation, especially with our newest users.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>I am very active within the community. Despite the flow of bad questions and answers in the site, I strive to not only provide answers, or some form of guidance, but strive to make the answers good as well, whether it's improving on a link or just explaining a code snippet.</p></li>
<li><p>I will admit my edit and flag numbers are low, but that's because I spent the time most people do in the queue bouncing around the new questions page providing votes and comments and close votes if needed. I am more than willing to dedicate time every day in the queue.</p></li>
<li><p>I can be a troll, but in my experience with obtaining site ""power"", I have not abused said power. For example, I used to be a kid (hard to imagine me as a child, I know, you just picture a shorter Archer), and I used to be quite an ass.

<p>I am a numbers person. So let's start with the numbers; here's what are my numbers compared to the requirements:</p>

<li><strong>Civic Duty</strong>: Voted 300 or more times – I've voted ~1,600 times</li>
<li><strong>Strunk &amp; White</strong>: Edited 80 posts – I've got Copy Editor and ~1300 edits.</li>

<li><strong>Convention</strong>: 10 posts with score of 2 on meta – I have 78 of them.</li>

<p>Why I might <strong>not</strong> be a good moderator:</p>

I am probably less inclined to close questions and delete answers than most people here. </p>

<p>That stems from my belief that everyone should have a chance, and that we should be more friendly to new users and novice programmers. Was everyone here born an expert programmer? Did everyone make high quality posts on SO from their very first post? Probably not.</p></li>
<li><p>There are people who probably dislike me because I am vocal on some issues (like <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/73133/regex-and-html-the-long-tail-annoys-me/104936#104936"">this</a>). I am also vocal on answers I believe to be wrong, so if you've received a -1 from me, don't take it personally and note that at least I had the courtesy of explaining why I did it.</p>

<p>I consider myself a fair and balanced person, and that in a short while, has come to understand very well the spirit of this community.</p>

<p>Against me I have that my experience in programming is short, by no means I would consider myself an absolute expert compared to many of the very talented programmers here. I believe that this would be without a doubt my greatest shortcoming as candidate. (Remember: above all, be honest). </p>

<p>If I had to say another thing, this would be the language (native spanish speaker) I consider I have a decent written english but that sometimes my lack of vocabulary may play against the clarity of the question/answer.</p>

<p>I'll go point by point, good moderators often:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Have a reasonably high reputation to indicate active participation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In three months I have achieved 3000 points (aprox), not huge amount but in my opinion denotes a sufficient level of commitment considering the time.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Show interest in their meta's community-building activities</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members</strong></li>

<p>Well that you will have to decide it yourseld, but, in a final note:</p>

<p>I know the chances of me being elected as a moderetor a fairly low and understand the reasons behind this perfectly, the main reason I am nominating myself as a moderator is because I would like to give back to the community more that what I'm doing right now.</p>

<p>As I said, I'm not a brilliant developer, so, my possibility to answer questions is quite limited. This is why I would love the opportunity to guide the community in a way I know I can, with patience, determination, effort and a lot of common sense.</p>

<p>I'm a very long standing member of the Stack Overflow community.  I have been on the site since private beta an have participated in meta since its inception. (I'm on the first page reputation-wise on meta.)</p>

<p>This is the 3rd time I've run for moderator now.  I've narrowly missed being elected in each.  I was essentially the first runner up from the last one.</p>

<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>

<p>As a moderator I'm mostly an inclusionist.  I believe that people who contribute to the site should be given time to bring contributions up to our community standard.  However, if any content on the site is considered below our standard, and the contributor has not made an effort to clean it up, it should be removed from the site to prevent clutter;</p>

<p>I am very aware of and spend time viewing lots of the other Stack Exchange sites, so I am very familiar with what belongs here and what doesn't.</p>

<p>I also understand that clutter will be the eventual downfall of the site, and keeping Stack Overflow's signal to noise ratio will be my first concern.</p>

<p><strong>Credentials:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Long history with the site</li>
<li>All of the required badges (including lots of ones that aren't required)</li>
<li>Long-standing history of participation</li>
<li>Fun and hard-working attitude</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>

<p>I love Stack Overflow.  And I know many many other people do as well.  Vote for me and I will keep this site up and running smoothly for every one to enjoy and benefit from.</p>

<p>I'm constantly flagging things for mod attention, and they're almost always acted on, which is probably a good sign. I also spend a ridiculous amount of time <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/145982/michael-mrozek"">on meta</a>, and I've posted the comment ""you'll have to wait for a moderator to fix that"" entirely too many times.

<p>I'll keep my Stack Overflow backstory short; you can read the rest <a href=""http://bit.ly/1FcNXGs"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've been a member of Stack Overflow for a little over a year, but it was a strong force in helping me learn to program years before that (and it still is, as you can never really be finished learning about programming). I'd like to give back, so I decided to throw my name into the ring.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have no clue if I'd make a good moderator. And I admit not being as enthusiastic about being one like some of the other nominees. I don't consider being a moderator a big thing. I am definitely not applying for fame or power here. But then again, maybe that's what would make me a good one, because I like to do the maintenance work.</p>

<p>I've read through a Theory of Moderation and understand that being a moderator is not about exerting power but about interfering as little as possible, preferably in the background. I think I can handle that.</p>

<p>Checking on flags and especially merging questions sounds like a welcome addition to my usual activities on StackOverflow. I'm already spending quite some time flagging and tagging and being a moderator could help me improve on these. The ""housekeeping"" is what I would mainly be looking forward to.

<p>When I initially became a member of SO, I was self-centered, there was a healthy concern about increasing reputation and comparing myself to others.  While I wouldn't judge anyone and say this is <em>bad</em> behavior, it runs contrary to what a moderator does.</p>

<p>However, over time, I came to value the importance of maintaining the health of the ecosystem rather than my own reputation; this is evidenced by the flattening of my reputation curve and the increase in the number of edits for clarity (while maintaing the author's original meaning and style), retagging, voting (up, down, to close) and flagging for attention (even flagging my own question for because it was <em>too</em> specific).</p>

<p>Yes, content is king on SO, but without the participation of the community in these areas, it becomes like any other web board, and as we know, it isn't just another web board.</p>

<p>Now, while there are many who can do the same things on SO, and those that have even more ability if they have over 10K using the admin tools, it's not the fact that I use these tools that I believe makes me a good candidate.  It's the fact that I believe it is my <em>responsibility</em> to use these tools to contribute to a healthy ecosystem that makes me a good candidate.</p>

<p>Being nominated (and hopefully, elected) to a moderator would help further my ability to fulfil that responsibility.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration and best wishes to everyone that is nominated.</p>

<hr>

<p>Looking at some of the other nominations, it appears that I haven't engaged in enough politicking and elaborated on what I feel the responsibilities of a modeator are and how I would fulfil them.</p>

<p>I've touched on it breifly in stating the importance of maintaining the health of the ecosystem and that as a part of that community, I have a responsibility to contribute to that goal.</p>

<p>As far as a specific guideline as to <em>how</em> that will be achieved, I think that <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/posts/39457/revisions"">Chip Uni</a> came the closest on <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com"">meta</a> with his reply to the question <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39405/moderator-accountability-request/39457#39457"">""Moderator Accountability Request.""</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, moderators should <strong>only</strong> do what the rest of the community cannot.</p>
  
  <p>Stack Overflow does not need a moderator to close down somewhat-questionable 
  questions. Dozens of 3000+ reputation users already rapidly vote to close down questions. 
  Let the community make those decisions. </p>
  
  <p>On the other hand, plenty of things can't be done by non-moderators. 
  We need you to look for suspicious voting patterns. We need you to be a <strong>neutral</strong> arbiter. 
  We need you to use the tools that you have, and that we don't.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I absolutely agree with this, and <strong>doing the work that other users cannot</strong> would be my <strong>first priority every time I am on SO</strong>.</p>

<p>That's not to say that I would not contribute in non-moderator ways to the community.  However, when doing so, I would not use the abilities of a moderator to hasten a result that the community will come to on its own.</p>

<p>An example would be voting to close a thread.  If I see that a thread has three votes to close, I will not auto-close it, the community is trending in that direction, and the community should be the arbiter of that decision.</p>

<p>If I have a personal opinion that the thread should be closed, I'll do what everyone else does, cast my vote to close, and move on.</p>

<p>And since I didn't mention this before, if there are specific questions that you have, feel free to post them in the comments, and I'll adjust my nomination accordingly to answer.</p>",14,2011-01-19 14:19:11.200000+00:00,2011-01-19 14:19:11.200000+00:00,2011-01-21 14:33:54.787000+00:00,2014-04-24 17:07:48.717000+00:00,,-1,,50776,6,119,

<p>Hello, I am Christian Gollhardt, 27 years old, from Germany and have been developing for almost 15 years. 5 years ago, I joined Stack Overflow and was instantly thrilled with the community mission.</p>

<p><strong>Why me?</strong></p>

<p>I visit Stack Overflow almost every day. During the day, to find solutions, in the evening to answer questions. However, because of the flood of questions, I seldom find anything worth answering. This could be related to the fact that the tags I follow are mostly mature.</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to contribute better to the community.</p>

<p>Moderation is a time-consuming task. Especially if you try to be good and fair. Since I've already worked in some communities before the time of Stack Exchange, I know how important moderation is. It's a small degree that determines whether a community is helpful or a rather bad joke that can not be taken seriously.</p>

<p>As an elected community moderator, I will do my best to keep Stack Overflow reputable.</p>

<p>I'm Rob, a 29 year old Australian (AEST timezone), currently working as a senior software developer.  </p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, I've focused more keenly on the moderation side of the site, and have been involved in a few projects used to aid in the moderation of the site.<br>
I'm involved with Smoke Detector as a user, and I spend most of my time these days in the ""New Answers To Old Questions"" page, raising numerous flags regarding non-answers, suspected sock-puppets, plagiarism and spam which gets past Smoke Detector.<br>
I typically spend an hour or two every day undertaking moderation duties.</p>

<p>As my involvement in the site has become more and more focused on moderation, I figured it's time to nominate myself, allowing me to be more effective with the actions I take. </p>

<p>Having access to moderator tools will allow me to moderate much more effectively; cutting out the middle man, and providing me with tools to make quick, educated decisions.</p>

<p>I am also a moderator on some non-stack exchange sites, and I lead some local user group sessions, so this is already something I'm doing. I definitely enjoy being of service to a community and pitching in where I can. Other reasons to elect me would probably include my rather extensive involvement in the stack chats, my mid-level rep here on the site (yes, 6.8k is a little low), and the fact that adding filler to my paragraphs looks better, since they're more flushed out.

<li><strong>I treat everyone with respect.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I do lots of quality control and cleanup.</strong> I've raised over 6,500 flags, 99.2% of them ""helpful.""</li>

<p>I am a long-time IT professional and in my 25 year professional career, I gained expertise in a diverse array of application development technologies. Having been an active member of Stack Overflow for roughly two years now, I take more pride in my constructive and level-headed contributions than I do in any particular technical expertise. While this is a community of technology experts, I view it as our responsibility to not only contribute constructively to discussions, but just as importantly, to do so without belittling the less experienced members of our community.</p>

<p>I have run several businesses, ranging from small IT and management consulting practices to conducting the turn-around of a mid-sized logistics business. There are lessons that I learned about building highly-effective teams in those organizations that I try to bring to bear in my Stack Overflow interactions, namely, I strive to provide constructive counsel, recognize people for their contributions, but at the same time, promptly addressing inappropriate behavior, but doing so in a respectful manner.</p>

<p>I am going to nominate myself. I think I'd make a good moderator for several reasons.</p>

<p>The first is I feel that I have a strong understanding of the Stack Overflow community, and what people expect of the community. I do my best to help people, and always helping improve the content by using the community moderator tools when I have spare cycles.</p>

<p>I also have the right personality for this. I have moderated online communities in the past (The Microsoft ASP.NET Forums). While I understand that Stack Overflow is certainly not a forum, it does take a certain personality to moderate a community: don't be bullish, don't disrespect people, and always work with people by treating them like people.</p>

<p>I'm also as active as time allows on this site. I do genuinely like this site and what it does, and find myself spending a lot of time on it. If I am able to help the moderators with my spare time, I think that is a win. Begin a moderator isn't just a fancy for me, I commit to what I own.</p>

<p>Finally, I think I have a good grasp of Stack Overflow. I understand the community, and what it thinks is on/off topic, and good/bad behavior.</p>",15,2014-02-10 20:19:59.383000+00:00,2014-02-10 20:19:59.383000+00:00,2014-02-19 20:08:06.727000+00:00,2014-04-25 11:18:23.540000+00:00,,-1,,492405,6,441,

<p>I've been a moderator on other sites for a while, but I'm really a programmer, and keep coming back to this site. I wish I was better able to manage the closed queue and help beat it down to size. I wish I was better able to help our around here in general. And I hope you'll give me that opportunity!</p>

<p>Things that I'm for:</p>

<ol>
<li>We do need to maintain a certain quality on SO.</li>
<li>We should be helpful to newbies. We were all there once upon a time, but eventually we learn the ropes.</li>
<li>I'm an avid <a href=""/questions/tagged/android"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;android&#39;"" rel=""tag""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tKsDb.png"" height=""16"" width=""18"" alt="""" class=""sponsor-tag-img"">android</a> participant, and there's a lot of work that could be done to help clear that tag up. As a mod, and even as a non-mod, I intend to help out with that task. I'm also quite familiar with <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"">python</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/matlab"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;matlab&#39;"" rel=""tag"">matlab</a>, and <a href=""/questions/tagged/java"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;java&#39;"" rel=""tag"">java</a></li>
<li>I would use more than the 40 close votes that I can to reduce the number of questions in the closed queue. Plus as a mod, I would get more weight, 1 close vote = 1 fewer questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>A few fun stats, as of Sunday Feb 16:</p>

<ul>

4769614,"<p>My name is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/419/kev"">Kevin Kenny</a>, I work as a software developer for a UK web hosting company. I've <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kev"">worked in the IT industry</a> for a <em>long</em> time having been a field engineer, data centre ops supervisor and now for the past few years a software developer. In addition I also architected much of our IIS7 environment and provide third line support for ASP.NET for when the front line guys reach the boundaries of their knowledge.</p>

<p>I've been a Stack Overflow user since the closed beta and over the past two years and five months have been an active participant on the site. I've decided to throw my hat into the ring this year because I think I've now got a good handle on the way the community works and the type of site Stack Overflow aims to be and I think I'd be a good moderator.</p>

<p>I'm a bit of a Windows generalist on Stack Overflow but specifically follow the IIS related tags because that's what I spend a lot of time writing code against.</p>

<p>As a moderator I will always allow the community at-large to decide what is good and what is bad using the conventions and tools available to it - the FAQ, voting, flagging, the close button. However the flagging tools are there for a reason and will act on these notifications sensibly. I don't have a power-hungry bone in my body but do like to see things done the right way and in a fair way. I'm also not a pedant or literalist, and do have the ability to read between the lines rather than take things just on face-value.</p>

<p>So rather than ramble on any further I thought I'd compile a list of what I think is good about me and of course a list of the bad.</p>

<p>The Good Stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have the patience of a saint - I'm happy to spend time fixing up really broken questions and answers where the english is almost indecipherable and I'm looking at a code formatting disaster.</li>
<li>I often spend quite a bit of time now merging OP content in answers that doesn't belong into chronologically sane ""updates"" in the original question.</li>
<li>I'm not afraid to politely nudge other users (new users and old-hands alike) where it looks like there's a comment bun fight about to begin and ask them nicely to calm down a bit.</li>
<li>I can't abide rudeness - especially to users where it's abundantly clear their english is weak. I find it disappointing when I see 2k+ users who's first language is english preferring to insult rather than use their new found edit privilege to try and improve a post.</li>
<li>I can't abide officious, condescending and patronising comments.</li>
<li>I use my moderator flags heavily.</li>
<li>I work from home and can spend quite a bit of time on Stack Overflow. You can usually see me from around 09:30 until 02:30 UTC and at weekends, so I think my availability is good</li>
<li>I can spot a subjective/flamewar question a mile away.</li>
<li>In my day job I deal with all sorts of customers, from the clueless, the irrational, the smartass to the old-hats and folks who know what they're doing. This is via our support system, emails and telephone. I guess the point being is that I don't live in a cave and can actually communicate well under all sorts of circumstances.</li>
<li>I'm a huge believer in the ""be nice"" philosophy in the FAQ and will often cheerfully refer other users to this essential guideline if I see something brewing.</li>
<li>I'm not afraid to admit when I don't know the answer and will happily consult others before taking a unilateral decision that might affect others negatively.</li>
<li>I'm happy to be proved wrong.</li>
<li>I like rainbows and waffles.</li>
<li>I'm human.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bad Stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've not always been a good citizen and did participate (to my shame) in some edit wars with certain individuals back in the early days.</li>
<li>I've not always been in agreement with Jeff+Team and have perhaps ""shouted"" my difference of opinion a bit louder than was necessary, and perhaps with hindsight crossing the border into being insulting. I'm not proud of this.</li>
<li>I have once emailed team@stackoverflow.com to apologise and promise ""not do it again"".</li>
<li>I don't always concur with some of the views on Meta. That said, if a policy or the will of the community has been accepted then I'll abide by these conventions - I used to see no harm in salutations and sigs. Now they get removed if I'm editing a post.</li>
<li>I probably don't spend enough time in ""chat"", but then time spent chatting isn't time spent answering questions, removing cruft and fixing posts.</li>
<li>I sometimes like my cheese left where it is, and not a millimeter out of place</li>
<li>I've downvoted Jon Skeet</li>
<li>I don't like unicorns or ponies</li>
<li>I'm human.</li>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>I'm Magisch. I'm working as a Software Developer and Sysadmin in a small company in Germany. I work mostly with C and Javascript as well as TeX. </p>

<h2>Why you? You haven't been so active in the last year</h2>

<p>It's true, I haven't been so active on SO Meta and in the review queues in the past year. This is because I've spent most of my Stack Overflow time on finding and flagging serial voting the script didn't catch - over 850 incidents so far, with about 80-100 new ones per week right now. In this, I've learned quite well to spot serial voting, and I'd like to keep refining and improving this skill as a moderator here. I'm also a part of Charcoal, a network wide spam flagging project.</p>

<h2>What about the rest? Moderating isn't just about catching serial voting</h2>

<p>I do believe in the theory of moderation, and prior to my current obsession, I was quite active on Stack Overflow and on Meta. </p>

<h2>What about your rep? You don't even have 10k tools yet.</h2>

<p>Not on this site, that's true. I do have experience in how to use them on other communities, however.

<p><strong>Hi! I'm Karl, and I'm here to make sure Stack Overflow remains the site to find quality answers with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to be a moderator to clean up the site and teach others to help out. I've already contributed by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flagging helpfully over 9,800 times</li>
<li>Completing over 20,000 reviews</li>
<li>Participating actively on Meta </li>
<li>Taking part in chat (mainly JavaScript and MSE's Tavern)</li>

<ul>
<li>Spends 2-3 hours per day on SO</li>
<li>Time zone: UTC+8</li>
<li>Mainly active in the <a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a> tag (score: ~560)</li>
</ul>

<h1>My philosophy</h1>

<p>I believe that <strong>enforcement and education <em>together</em></strong> go hand in hand in ensuring that users improve their behaviour/posts. Each has little effect without the other:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advising the user without doing anything doesn't create much of a mandate for them to do something about their posts.</li>
<li>Knocking a user down if they don't know how to get back up won't make them improve—instead they'd leave or rage-quit by vandalising/trolling.</li>

However, I can be very fair, open-minded, and would love to hear suggestions from the community so I could help to shape those ideas into something that can be implemented with great style on the site. </p>

Anyway, I am a room owner of <strong><em>The</em></strong> Android room and I think most folks in there would say I'm fair.I do feel that I have adequate experience on SE with answers, questions, comments, edits, and the like to show that I understand the site well enough to would be a good moderator. </p>",17,2015-04-06 20:52:38.950000+00:00,2015-04-06 20:52:38.950000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:38:14.550000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:38:14.550000+00:00,,811,,1380752,6,572,

<ul>

<li><p>I'm able to <strong>put in the time</strong> to moderate Stack Overflow—I'm usually on when I have time off (most of the day), but at least an hour for sure. (Note: my timezone's UTC+8.)</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Bring a <strong>quality before quantity</strong> mindset to the moderation team from what I already do.</p></li>

<p>I'm Mooseman. A programmer in the US who is severely addicted to the internet. I already <a href=""http://meta.lifehacks.stackexchange.com/q/2466/15"">moderate at Lifehacks SE</a>. Besides the day-to-day moderator duties (being a so-called ""human exception handler""), I believe we can all agree that</p>

<h2>Spam must die.</h2>

<p>One thing I love about the Stack Overflow community is that we work together to destroy garbage. Through means such as <a href=""http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/89"">the tavern</a> we can get a lot done. Being a moderator would help me to help the community by burning the most hideous of spam with a single vote. I'd be honored to do so with every click.</p>

<p>I also achieve a sense of satisfaction when reviewing custom flags; reviewing the many situations that arise and helping the community get along and grow.</p>

<p>Working towards a consensus whenever possible and doing my best to suggest reasonable solutions to problems is a challenge I enjoy. I believe I know when to ask for the thoughts and advice of others.</p>

<p>For anyone who has ever wondered: ""deceze"" stands for my initials, D. C. Z.; it's not a misspelling of ""decease"". You can call me David. You may have seen me around, I've been here a while. I've been here so long that a lot of the time I answer questions by closing them as duplicates of answers I've written before, or of answers I've seen a million times already. I love seeing and contributing new content, but quite honestly a lot of things here just need categorising, sorting and moderation by now, since the existing library of content is already so well established.</p>

<p>This might sound like I'm down on Stack Overflow, but I'm really not. I'm still here regularly. Even though I've got one more kid now than I did during the last election, I'm <em>still</em> here a lot. Stack Overflow is such a fantastic collection of knowledge accumulated by so many people, it simply must be preserved, curated and carefully extended. As a moderator, I'd see this as my primary task: keeping Stack Overflow usable for the purpose of finding knowledge. Squabbles, disputes and misdeeds will be resolved erring on the side of this vast knowledge pool, not any one particular user.</p>",20,2015-11-13 09:49:46.853000+00:00,2015-11-13 09:49:46.853000+00:00,2015-11-20 19:52:02.663000+00:00,2015-11-20 19:52:02.663000+00:00,,811,,476,6,4325,
4733113,"<p>Greetings from Norway, great community.</p>

<p>I understand the need to have moderators for a site like this, and would like to nominate myself to this position.</p>

<p>I have been a part of this site since early beta, and have watched it grow in leaps and bounds since then, and don't think that the future will look much different. I want a bigger part in this bright future.</p>

<p>I would like to say that I've always been the poster child for best behavior, but I'm human. You'll find comments on this site which plainly tells people that they're barking up the wrong tree. However, I put much effort into my work on this site, evident in answers such as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5727/what-are-the-barriers-to-understanding-pointers-and-what-can-be-done-to-overcome/5754#5754"">What are the barriers to understanding pointers and what can be done to overcome them?</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/143552/comparing-date-ranges/143568#143568"">Comparing date ranges</a>.</p>

<p>However, neither of those two answers, or any of my other answers, should have much of an impact on whether you should vote on me, since I will still be answering questions on Stack Overflow, regardless of how this election turns out. Also, the work a moderator is required to perform does not hinge on the ability to provide great answers.</p>

<p>So, I nominate myself.</p>

<p>As qualifications, unverifiable as they are by you, the votee, I will mention my 12-year position as board member of the housing complex I live in (32 apartments), so I have some experience with handling things that aren't always cut and dry. People are human, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>As for moderation...</p>

<p>Moderators needs to be the voice of the community. They need to handle the things the community cannot, but which the community would, if they could. This means they have to handle the rough edges, cut the diamond so to speak, by using the moderator tools that aren't available to the rest of the community.</p>

<p>Moderators have power, but with power comes responsibility. To moderate a SE site means wielding that power with a light touch, and only apply pressure when needed.</p>

<p>Personally I would not jump right into it. I would flex the moderator muscles little by little in order to ease into the role, leaning on the other moderators and Meta for advice and guidance.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for your time, now <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/review"">back the regular program</a>.</p>",20,2011-01-19 08:21:45.060000+00:00,2011-01-19 08:21:45.060000+00:00,2011-01-26 21:56:13.820000+00:00,2011-01-26 21:56:13.820000+00:00,,267,,267,6,514,

Further, I have heard a great deal from the current Stack Overflow moderators and I am confident I can handle the stress of moderating here. </p>

<p>As it is, I spend much of my time on the Stack Exchange network performing site maintenance - editing questions and approving others' edits,  adding constructive comments, and closing questions when necessary, here and elsewhere. As evidence, I present my badges - Copy Editor and Reviewer on three different sites (SO, SFF, Unix), plus Proofreader here. </p>

<p>Being a moderator will give me the tools to use my time here more efficiently, making our site and, by extension, the greater StackExchange network an even greater place to be.</p>

<p>A moderator is expected to be a fair, dispassionate and open-minded person, capable of handling delicate situations and taking responsibility for their actions. I believe I fit this description.</p>

<p>In case anyone's checking, I <em>do</em> use available moderation tools. I'm one of the more active close/delete/down/up-voters, and I also use my Python duplicate hammer (among the top 100 hammer users). Of the hundreds of flags I've cast over the past year, only two were declined. I hope this portrays me as someone who's well acquainted with the site rules. While I'm more inclined towards ""field work"", i.e., reviewing posts as I discover them (often within the first seconds of their existence), I will focus on the moderator flag queue if elected.</p>

<p>I participate in Meta (mostly silently), help managing the Python chat room on this site and expect to collaborate with the community more closely as a moderator.</p>

<p>Why should you support my candidacy? </p>

<p>I believe a site less clogged with bad questions is a more usable site. There are 114.8K questions in the Close Votes review queue. If that sounds like way too many, you want me in there clearing those instead of adding 50 more questions a day from the New Questions page to the queue and having no votes left to do reviews (although I'll occasionally still go through the queue and Skip the bad questions and vote to Leave Open the good ones, because I feel that any dent made to the queue improves reviewer morale and will lead to more people reviewing more close votes...)</p>

4748819,"<p>I've been a Stack Overflow user for two years, as well as an avid user of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/50049/tim-post?tab=accounts"">several other Stack Exchange web sites</a>. I'm a retired pro-tem moderator from Webmasters SE and did my very best to help turn it into a successful site. At the time, moderator nominations were conducted on individual meta sites, I was nominated and accepted. Unfortunately, this collided with a life altering job change and schedule. Things have settled again, and I miss moderating. I was also the operator of a (now defunct) SE 1.0 site. I had the idea that a SE site for startup companies would work, so did several other people. </p>

<p>One of the things that attracts me to Stack Overflow and other sites in the network is that the <em>community</em> runs pretty much everything. My view on moderation is that we're here to do what the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39405/moderator-accountability-request/39457#39457"">community <em>can't</em></a>, while giving a bit of time to behind the scenes maintenance and upkeep to ensure that all visitors have the best possible experience.</p>

<p>The biggest difference in my opinion between moderators and users, beyond access to special privileges, is accountability. I'm ready and willing to be held accountable for every action that I take as a moderator. I think it is an absurdity to expect that everyone will like <em>every</em> action that you take as a moderator. I really value this community, and I will work to ensure it continues to thrive. That might mean locking something that found its way into StumbleUpon and received fifteen 'thank you' answers in an hour, or letting someone know through a variety of available tools that their behavior simply isn't acceptable for our community. I'm confident that the majority of my time will be spent doing more rewarding things, like asking people heavily vested in tags that lack tag wikis to create them.</p>

<p>Typically, I let the community speak with their votes and flags before taking action unless I'm certain that not taking action immediately would be detrimental to the community. Examples would be obvious SPAM or blatantly abusive behavior. </p>

<p>I don't have as much free time as many others, but I do spend a significant amount of what time I have on SO. If elected, that time would be even more productive. I tend to be on-line approximately 15 hours a day, active on SO and other SE sites at least 3 hours daily. My Skype ID as well a a link to a page that sends me e-mail is on my profile.</p>

<p>A little about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Husband &amp; Father</li>
<li>I work in the web hosting industry - That 'cloud' thing. Mostly I work on low level tools, APIs kernels and hypervisors.</li>
<li>Home is both US and Asia. We try our very best to visit a new country every year</li>
<li>I speak English , relatively broken Spanish and enough Tagalog (Filipino) to get by</li>
<li>I've been programming for over 20 years, 10 professionally</li>
<li>Avid amateur photographer who is ashamed to have little activity on photography SE</li>
<li>Free / Open Source software developer (yes, I have commit access to projects that aren't mine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Notable badges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suffrage (I tend to use all of my votes, frequently, it's not like they roll over)</li>
<li>Strunk &amp; White (I just can't help it)</li>
<li>Electorate (I love questions that give me something to do or think about)</li>
<li>Sportsmanship (I usually up vote answers before adding something I feel is missing)</li>
<li>Pundit (here and on MSO)</li>
<li>Convention (I tend to be quite vocal in the shaping of Stack Exchange)</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do I want to be a moderator?</p>

<ul>
<li>Every time I see something that should be fixed, I feel like I'm adding to someone else's work load by just flagging it. I'm a 10k+ user which means I should be able to fix most things, but the sheer volume of SO is quite taxing. This is equally compounded by knowing how odd flags can be.</li>
<li>SO needs diplomatic hands. I know the tools, I know how things work, I have a very good idea of how people work and I want to help.</li>
<li>I am a 3k + user on several other sites and can help guide question migration.</li>
<li>I'm not easily offended or disturbed, and there apparently was an opening</li>
<li>SO is a source of fun for me, I want to help improve it</li>
<li>I've moderated before and I fully know what the job entails.</li>
<li>Moderators should first and foremost <em>want</em> the responsibility. I do and I know what I'm getting myself into.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most memorable SO experience:</p>

<p>I helped to translate a question that was asked in Spanish. Someone arrived here and Chrome translated the page, so naturally, they asked a question in Spanish. A few of us pulled it out of down vote city, translated it and it actually ended up getting good answers. Now, I can't remember which one it was, but it is in my history for the morbidly curious. As broken as my Spanish is, it felt good to know enough to help someone.</p>

<p>My name is Kevin and I would like to nominate myself.</p>

<h3>Why me?</h3>

<p>If you really want to see why I will be a good moderator, have a look through my activity history, meta activity, and the ""more information about the candidates"" link above. But for those of you who want a summary here, here it is.</p>

<h3>What will I do as a mod?</h3>

<p>The same thing I've always done, just with the extra bit of power that comes with the diamond. Edit posts when they need it. Close or reopen questions when they deserve it. Delete questions and answers when necessary instead of just flagging. Dismiss flags instead of just reflagging or flagging as invalid.  Message, suspend, and delete users when absolutely necessary.  As a moderator on two sites (SciFi, Outdoors), I have plenty of experience moderating on the network.</p>

<h3>My background</h3>

<p>I have been an active member of the Stack Overflow community for well over two years and since day one it has been important to me to do my part to keep Stack Overflow great. I have not only the four silver badges required for this election but also the corresponding gold for the three that have one (Marshal, Copy Editor, Electorate), as well as a number of other badges. </p>",24,2014-02-11 21:47:17.767000+00:00,2014-02-11 21:47:17.767000+00:00,2014-02-19 20:00:26.520000+00:00,2014-04-25 11:18:23.540000+00:00,,-1,,900873,6,1003,

<p>I feel the most serious issue facing Stack Overflow is <strong>a constant deluge of garbage that crowds out useful and interesting content</strong>. This problem truly affects everyone: answerers, askers, and even infrequent browsers.</p>

<p>Although everyone has a role to play in helping to keep the site clean, that often isn't enough. We have too much cleaning to do, and too few people with the tools to handle it. <strong>I'm asking for you to entrust me with more and better ♦ tools, so I can get out there and work on this problem</strong> (and others, as they arise, of course).</p>

<p>I've been contributing here for a long time, monitoring a diverse (and changing) array of tags, and doing my best to moderate. I edit a <em>lot</em> of posts and thoroughly exercise my current privileges. I'm well-acquainted with our standards, and I have an excellent eye for quality. I'm also fair, reasonable, and committed.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic user, and I'm passionate about the quality of content here. I feel I can offer a good mix of even-handed moderation and persistent janitorial service.</p>

<p>I spend the majority of my time on Stack Overflow working on improving existing content, primarily through editing or flagging. After four years I'm ready to step into a more active role in the maintenance and upkeep of this incredible community.</p>

<p>I believe Stack Overflow should be a place for <em>reference quality</em> writing, where professionals and enthusiasts can find answers to non-trivial problems. I believe that it is Stack Overflow's signal-to-noise ratio that makes it worthwhile, and almost all of my time here is spent promoting that ideal.</p>

<p>I advocate a fairly strict adherence to the rules, which may appear overzealous to some, but I think our position is perhaps more precarious than people realize. <em>The Internet</em> would happily overrun Stack Overflow and turn it into another Yahoo Answers; it is our established users and their enforcement of our rules that keeps this from happening.</p>

<p>I want to moderate Stack Overflow so I can handle the relationship with the other software development related sites, such as Programmers, Code Review, and Programming Puzzles &amp; Code Golf.

<h2>What do I intend to do?</h2>

<p>As a 20k+ user, the extra abilities of a mod won't be <em>too</em> drastic of an improvement, I think the most significant thing you get by being a mod is the diamond. The diamond represents trust, it represents example by leadership, and it represents what's expected from all community members.</p>

<p>I intend to be more than a flag vacuum cleaner, my ideal is to serve an example on how to respond and interact with members of the community, I want to help users help themselves, by ensuring they understand the site and its policies.</p>

<li>I am and will remain active in chat. Both for moderator and for inquiries. </li>
<li>I know the tools of the trade, as well as the obligations required of me.</li>
<li>I have strong opinions about things, but am open to compromise based on the winds blowing in the community.</li>

<p>I monitor flag queues daily, check 10k tools, suggested edits queue, and of course the front page itself. My reputation gain has significantly slowed down since I became a moderator and I even lost a bunch of rep once we started clearing out older, now-significantly-offtopic questions. I'm always putting my duties as a moderator first and personal gains second.</p>

<p>I've worked with Stack Overflow moderators over the last 10 months or so and I know how much work is involved and how complex and/or tedious certain issues can be. I think I'm up to the challenge. I have all the requisite badges (including the two that were dropped from the criteria) and I'm <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/155160/anna-lear"">quite active</a> on Meta. I also have the time.</p>

<p>My SO rep leaves a bit to be desired, but I check in daily now both looking for questions to answer, questions that are possibly better asked on Programmers, and questions and answers that otherwise need attention. I gained roughly 2300 reputation since the last SO election, which perhaps isn't much but it's certainly a move in the right direction. :)</p>

<p>I know there's been some tension between Programmers and Stack Overflow, and I think it'd be kinda neat to have a moderator who's very well familiar with both sites and the rest of the network. I think I could be that moderator. </p>

Outright abuse is actually fairly rare and the rest of the time it's just people wondering why a decision has been made.

<p>After about two and half years participating in Stack Overflow and two elections I voted in, I'd like to throw my hat in the ring and nominate myself for moderation.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I've been programming professionally for the last fifteen years or so. I'm an avid <a href=""/questions/tagged/open-source"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;open-source&#39;"" rel=""tag"">open-source</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/unit-testing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;unit-testing&#39;"" rel=""tag"">unit-testing</a> and Iron Maiden enthusiast, not necessarily in that order. I believe that toughest skill a software engineer can master is removing code, and I pride myself on having a negative net contribution in terms of LOC in any project I'm involved in a major way (while delivering useful features, of course).</p>

<h1>Thoughts about Stack Overflow</h1>

<p>As long as it's within the On Topic list, we should be moderating the form of the content, not the content itself. SO should be a place where any programming enthusiast feels welcome, regardless of their level of experience. Having said that, content should be presented in a way that makes it easy to consume and discuss. Questions like ""Give me the codez for loop!!1"" shouldn't be removed because the OP doesn't know how to use a <code>for</code> loop, they should be removed because OP didn't even make an honest attempt to participate in this community. I believe that if we aren't welcoming to novice programmers, we're missing our mark, and as a moderator, that's what I would like to concentrate on.</p>",28,2015-11-10 06:57:48.587000+00:00,2015-11-10 06:57:48.587000+00:00,2015-11-20 19:51:32.273000+00:00,2015-11-20 19:51:32.273000+00:00,,811,,2422776,6,4567,

<p>I would like to give Stack Overflow something back for the whole time I saved with using the site. I hope that I can achieve more good things with moderating powers as I can do now.

<p>I've been an active member here for over two years, feel invested in the site, and would like to help maintain its quality as more developers turn to it as a resource.  After crossing the 10k reputation threshold, I've found myself spending more time performing the janitorial work of editing posts, flagging spam, and identifying duplicate or inappropriate content than answering questions.</p>

<p>My areas of expertise are in iOS and Mac development (I'm currently the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/tags/iphone/topusers"">top user in the <code>[iphone]</code> tag</a>, as well as several related ones), and I have taken a particular interest in cleaning up content within those areas.  The <code>[iphone]</code> tag is the 8th most popular one on the site, and as such it attracts a lot of duplicate questions and other items that need moderation.  However, there aren't enough users with voting privileges that frequent these tags to manage the flood of new questions there.</p>

<p>I believe that I have been professional and polite in my dealings with people here.  If there is any kernel of utility in a poorly worded question, I try to clean it up rather than downvote it or try to close it.  I also recognize the value of user-created content, and only vote to delete a question if I feel neither it nor its answers have any redeeming value whatsoever.  Finally, the other moderators can probably tell you how many times I've annoyed them with my various flags for items that I couldn't clean up myself.</p>

<p>For those concerned about the relatively high number of downvotes in my profile, a significant number come from the janitorial work I've done since gaining access to the 10k tools a year ago.  I don't care much about my reputation now, so I have no problems in downvoting spam, offensive, or otherwise unsalvageable content that others simply leave to be deleted.  In fact, looking at a recalculated reputation report shows that only 614 of the downvotes I've cast are still counted, meaning that ~70% of the material I've downvoted has since been deleted from the site (ignoring the few CW items I've voted on).  I've also described <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61596/why-are-people-allowed-to-downvote-0-voted-questions-without-giving-a-reason/61607#61607"">here</a> the situations in which I've used downvotes within the tags I frequent.</p>

<p>The time I spend on Stack Overflow causes no problems with my employer, being that I'm a cofounder of the company, so I would be able to help at regular times throughout the U.S. Central Time work day in addition to off hours.</p>

<p>Again, I've enjoyed participating on Stack Overflow and would like a chance to help the site stay an incredible resource for programmers going forward.</p>",28,2011-01-18 22:39:19.080000+00:00,2011-01-18 22:39:19.080000+00:00,2011-01-19 19:06:01.067000+00:00,2014-04-24 17:07:48.717000+00:00,,-1,,19679,6,256,

<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Oliver. I would like to become one of your moderators. Stack Overflow has always helped me when learning to program. My early interactions with SO consisted of giving back by answering questions. Once I found out that the users, not just elected moderators, could moderate the site, I realized I could give back even more by helping to improve the quality of posts on SO. I love that we can make this site better just by taking out the trash (voting to close/delete) and editing borderline posts into quality submissions.</p>

<p>I'm a Room Owner of SOCVR, a chat room focused on site moderation. Over the last couple of years, my work with SOCVR has helped me tremendously to become a better site moderator - what to look for, how to handle edge cases, always being responsible to the community for my actions, and more. I get exposed to so many different scenarios to evaluate, which lets me judge new posts faster.</p>

<p>I believe Stack Overflow is a place for reference-quality writing, and I believe votes (up <em>and</em> down) and comments are a great way of providing feedback when content doesn't meet this high bar. It <em>is</em> a high bar, but it is also the reason Stack Overflow is what it is: The best place on the Internet for hobbyist and professional developers to get <em>quality</em> feedback in exchange for asking <em>good</em> questions.</p>

<p>At the same time, new users are the lifeblood of any site. It's too easy to place the burden of getting their first post just right on new users. I believe our experienced users and moderators have a duty to teach new users how to contribute, by leading by example and where that fails, gentle encouragement.</p>

<p>I'm back after narrowly losing last year to humbly ask again for the opportunity to be your moderator.</p>",30,2015-04-06 20:52:23.270000+00:00,2015-04-06 20:52:23.270000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:34:48.600000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:34:48.600000+00:00,,811,,229044,6,7268,
8043622,"<p>I'd like to <em>-ahem-</em> humbly nominate myself for a moderator position on Stack Overflow. Although I've been a member for more than two years (since May 2009), I've only been active starting May 2010. That said, I've been <em>extremely active</em>, and I do somehow have <em>two</em> Yearling badges!</p>

<p>Anyway, first off, I'm <strong>19 years old</strong>, and I live in <strong>Singapore</strong>. So, I hail from the other side of the world — for many of you, anyway. If you think about timezone issues with users, questions and answers around the site, that may be a good or bad thing (I'm in UTC+8). I also happen to be <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/802/top-users-singapore"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the top user in my country by reputation</a>! I spend much more time on the site answering questions compared to other active Singaporean SE users like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/313758/yi-jiang"">Yi Jiang</a>, but we all contribute in our own ways to the same site(s) as a whole, which is nice :)</p>

<p>In terms of tags, you'll often find me answering questions about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frontend web development, which includes <a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/javascript"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;"" rel=""tag"">javascript</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/jquery"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jquery&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jquery</a>.</li>
<li>Web development with <a href=""/questions/tagged/php"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;php&#39;"" rel=""tag"">php</a>, where I'd been less active lately but I'm returning to.</li>
<li><a href=""/questions/tagged/ios"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ios&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ios</a> development with <a href=""/questions/tagged/objective-c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;objective-c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">objective-c</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/cocoa-touch"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cocoa-touch&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cocoa-touch</a>.</li>

<li>A little bit of <a href=""/questions/tagged/actionscript-3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;actionscript-3&#39;"" rel=""tag"">actionscript-3</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/flash"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;flash&#39;"" rel=""tag"">flash</a> as well. Unless you recognize me from <a href=""http://boltclock.newgrounds.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">elsewhere on the Internet</a>, it may surprise you that I've known and used Flash longer than PHP! Mostly for animation, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also, or otherwise, know me on Stack Overflow for:</p>

<ul>
<li>My ""specialty tag"", <a href=""/questions/tagged/css-selectors"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css-selectors&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css-selectors</a> (over 1000 questions total, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:106224+%5Bcss-selectors%5D"">over 20% answered by me</a>)</li>
<li>This question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/3009380/106224"">What&#39;s the shebang/hashbang (#!) in Facebook and new Twitter URLs for?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also carry out retags (<strong>lots and lots</strong> of retags on <a href=""/questions/tagged/html5"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html5&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html5</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css3&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css3</a> questions...), formatting edits, link fixes and others such in the aforementioned tags, so it's not just answering questions. In fact, I'm recently finding myself commenting and editing more than answering — so much that I've been among <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=editors&amp;filter=all"">the top 20 editors of all time</a> for a while!</p>

<p>Not that less or more of either is better, of course. However, as a moderator I believe I can be more efficient than ever with post revisions and other janitorial duties, as I continue with my question-answering business. While I actively add fresh content to the site, I'd love to help out with cleaning and polishing our currently-existing posts. ""Dust tends to settle"", and all that jazz.</p>

<p>I visit meta once in a while, but most of my time spent there is with questions and on voting on other posts. I'm trying to answer more meta questions!</p>

<p>In terms of flags, my flag weight is about <strong>670</strong> right now. I'll often flag bad posts that I come across while doing cleanup work, as well as posts where drama is brewing. Admittedly, the mod queue has been quite a turn-off for me with that consistently large number on the top bar; that's one reason why I feel bad about raising flags at times. Consequently, as a regular user, I also feel bad about being unable to help the existing moderators in dealing with the mod queue directly.</p>

<p>In short: I'm tired of raising flags (and I can't hold a candle to Brad Larson in that aspect!), and want to start resolving them. I imagine it'll be a challenge, again given that consistently large number up at the top, but I'd like to help out however I can.</p>

<p>Another thing I felt I <em>had</em> to bring up: you probably know me for leaving comments almost everywhere. And, well, you may know me for being quite snarky with my comments sometimes. I'm very much aware of that. But I'm doing my best to change that over time, because I'm frankly not liking the way I'm sometimes treating others either. If <em>anything else</em>, my reputation is at stake too :P And besides, moderators are humans too, right? (Well, except <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard"">Bill the Lizard</a>, maybe <em>-shrug-</em>)</p>

<p>Oh and yes, I'll continue to be active here in the coming months. My visit streak is at <strong>348 days</strong> as of this nomination phase, just less than three weeks shy of a full year! The last time I broke that streak was last November, when I went under the knife after being found with appendicitis. I'm not usually this sick, but obviously that was one time I was definitely not supposed to be here ;) I'm OK now, though!</p>

<p>Last but not least, at the end of the day I'm only sincerely hoping to improve myself so I can do a much more effective job at lending myself to improving the site for the rest of us. Whether I'm a moderator or not, though, I shall continue to contribute to the site to the best of my efforts and my ability. I'll definitely work to prove myself either way, and if I get chosen as a moderator this round or in the future, that'll certainly be another privilege, on top of one I already have of working with Stack Overflow itself.</p>",30,2011-11-07 22:36:26.243000+00:00,2011-11-07 22:36:26.243000+00:00,2011-11-18 18:03:04.403000+00:00,2011-11-18 18:03:04.403000+00:00,,106224,,106224,6,657,

<p>I have been an active member of Stack Overflow for the last three years, and have witnessed the spectacular growth of the site over that time.  I've benefited both from answers to my questions as well as lessons learned from answering others.  I'd like to help the site remain the best programming resource out there by keeping it clean as it continues to grow.</p>

<p>My area of expertise on Stack Overflow is on the Apple side of development, in particular their iOS devices.  I am currently the top all-time user in the <a href=""/questions/tagged/iphone"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'iphone'"" rel=""tag"">iphone</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/ios"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'ios'"" rel=""tag"">ios</a>, and a few related tags.  While I enjoy developing for Mac and iOS right now, I work with many platforms on a regular basis and believe that specific technologies are less important than the real-world problems you are trying to solve with them.</p>

<p>However, my questions and answers are not why I believe I am qualified to be a moderator.  Lately, I've found myself spending far more time performing janitorial work, by flagging, casting close votes, and, when appropriate, voting to delete exceptionally bad content.  </p>

<p>As of this writing, I've cast 6870 flags, with 2468 of those deemed helpful, 6 declined, and 8 disputed (the rest were cast before these stats were counted).  I've flagged 1493 instances of spam, and was one of the first users to receive the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/badges/1298/marshal"">Marshal</a> badge.  I believe I've shown that I can identify material which is inappropriate for the site, but rather than jam up the moderation queue with flags, I'd be glad to help process them and take some of the load off of the existing moderators.</p>

<p>For content that can be salvaged, I've spent a significant amount of time editing questions into shape.  I have the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/badges/223/copy-editor"">Copy Editor</a> badge and I am more than happy to find questions with rough English, but a good core problem, and turn them into something that attracts votes and quality answers.</p>

<p>I'm a cofounder of the company I work at, so they're not going to fire me for the time I spend on the site.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that I've always been polite and professional when dealing with people here on Stack Overflow.  A moderator needs to maintain a cool head, and I believe that I would be able to do so if elected.</p>",31,2011-11-07 23:04:19.310000+00:00,2011-11-07 23:04:19.310000+00:00,2011-11-07 23:04:19.310000+00:00,2011-11-07 23:04:19.310000+00:00,,19679,,19679,6,592,

<p>""439 days, 439 consecutive"". I'm still a relatively new user but it stands to show that as soon as I became a member, I was hooked.</p>

<p>It's my goal to be more than a janitor. I want to be the guy that drives around in a big floor squeegee machine, cleaning up all the no-good-feely questions and answers and smiling while passing out helpful feedback. </p>

<p>Here's my top 5 reasons why I would make a decent mod:</p>

<p>5) I'm actively active </p>

<p>4) I leave constructive feedback most of the time</p>

<p>3) I want to guide the community to become a better place (I use too many downvotes and not enough upvotes)</p>

<p>2) I strongly believe in Stack Exchange and its purpose in helping others (not doing someone else's work)</p>

<p>1) I never cease to amaze my fellow Overflowians with my fair and respectful comments</p>

<p>Now for all you haters out there, I just want to say that I stand by my less than perfect comments. The amount of ""do this for me"" and lack of effort questions have been driving the quality of the site down. I feel that this <em>can</em> change, with less drive-by down-votes and more appropriate feedback. As a mod, constructive feedback has a bigger impact and represents the community in a positive way. </p>",31,2014-02-10 20:45:20.007000+00:00,2014-02-10 20:45:20.007000+00:00,2014-02-19 20:00:01.173000+00:00,2014-04-25 11:18:23.540000+00:00,,-1,,679449,6,191,

<p>Our flag queues are growing. A moderator must be hard-working and commit the time to acting as a janitor. Hopefully my work on projects such as <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290346"">2015 Election Live Vote Monitor</a>, <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289995"">2015 Moderator Candidate Activity Profiles</a>, <a href=""http://bit.ly/1G3ZqbD"" rel=""nofollow"">questionnaire viewer</a>, etc. have shown my work ethic. As a freelancer, I set my own schedule and can continue to commit my time. Being fairly active during the down time of other moderators, I will improve our response time to issues during off hours.</p>

<p>Moderators must be <em>respectful, open-minded, and fair</em>. Moderators are an extension of the community. I believe in firm but <em>flexible</em> moderation: Communities grow organically, I will uphold evolving values.</p>

<p>I am patient with even the most frustrating users, firm but gentle when needed (frustration often stems from deeper systemic issues). Hopefully, my <a href=""http://bit.ly/1ImGLVY"" rel=""nofollow"">various responses on meta</a> illustrate that I demonstrate patience and respect.

<h3>I have lots of time to moderate.</h3>

<p>I've visited Stack Overflow for 404 days out of less than 425 that I've been registered, with 270 of those days being consecutive. During the average of 3 hours daily I spend on Stack Overflow, I actively answer questions and seek out terrible questions to close and non-answers to delete, spam to clean up and misguided Facebook users to redirect.</p>

<h3>I make the right decisions.</h3>

<p>The only ""proof"" of this is 1234 helpful flags, 20 declined, all but one of which were long in the past. But I've never closed anything unfairly and I've never downvoted for any of the wrong reasons.</p>

<h3>I always prefer to clean up than erase.</h3>

<p>There's no feeling better than a huge edit!</p>

<h3>Whatever the outcome, I can still help without being a moderator.</h3>

<p>Anybody with more than 20,000 reputation gets access to a wide range of moderator tools, which I've used. Lots. <strong>But I'd like to make a bigger impact.</strong> Please consider me, and thank you Stack Overflow.</p>",32,2012-06-04 23:48:25.823000+00:00,2012-06-04 23:48:25.823000+00:00,2012-06-10 23:19:58.387000+00:00,2012-06-10 23:19:58.387000+00:00,,707111,,707111,6,2046,

<h2>Why Me?</h2>

<p>I firmly believe in SO as a learning resource, and like to consider myself one of its success stories. In a little under 3 years, SO has taught me how to be an effective programmer, and now, I'm looking for the next way to give back, and to help others who are just starting out.</p>

<p>Additionally, I already spend a minimum of 4-6 hours a day on SO, (more than meeting the participation requirement) and strongly believe in utilizing the voting system (currently 5138 up / 4288 down).</p>

<h2>Why Not Me?</h2>

<p>I don't have the best meta participation, but only because I rarely find situations on meta where someone else hasn't already voiced an opinion I agree or disagree with, in which case, up and down votes are usually more than adequate.</p>

<p>Some reasons on why I should be voted:</p>

<p><strong>Dedication:</strong> I've been an active member since the past 3 years, clocking in  over 900 days of visits.</p>

<p><strong>Community building:</strong> I'm quite active on Meta Stack Overflow, Super User and Super User Meta. I visit /review on a regular basis, often drop a comment explaining what a member can do to improve his experience here. </p>

<p><strong>Prior Experience in Moderation:</strong> I've been a Moderator on <a href=""http://superuser.com/election/1"">Super User</a> since the past year and I know and understand very well what it takes to be a Moderator. </p>

<p><strong>Badges:</strong> Badges on Stack Exchange are often an award for good behaviour, some of the noteworthy badges that I've earned include: Copy Editor, Electorate, Fanatic, Reviewer, Convention, Necromancer, Yearling(x3), Marshal</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Amongst other things, I'm always available on Chat. Also, I'm about halfway across the world from the US, in India so there's another set of eyes from a different timezone.</p>

<p>Many of you may recognize me from my work primarily in the Java and C# tags.  Or from my involvement on <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com"">Meta</a>, and maybe for my work on StackWrap4J on StackApps.  I hope I have left a good impression and don't need to make a case for moderator.</p>

<p>But the vast majority of you probably don't recognize me.  So, this is for you:</p>

<p>I have been a part of this community since the very beginning. (Well almost.  I joined near the tail end of the private beta.)  I have been consistently visited this site for ~2.5 years, so I know how this community works inside and out.  While I primarily answer questions in the Java and C# tags I view a high volume of questions in other tags.  I am always up for learning new things.</p>

<p><strong>I am very excited to have this opportunity to run for moderator on this awesome site.</strong>  I would love to join the ranks of Bill the Lizard, Michael Myers, and all of the rest.  They do such a great job with the community already and it would be an honor to be listed among them.</p>

<p><strong>My theory on moderation is that less is more.</strong>  Moderators don't decide the direction the community takes.  Their goal is to speak for the community and uphold the principles that it has decided are important.  </p>

<p>As a moderator I will work hard to keep the site clean.  I will make sure that I moderate fairly.  I will often ask for advice from senior moderators.  They will be my role models.  </p>

<p>I'm not afraid to make the tough calls though.  If something doesn't belong on the site, I will vote to move it.  Negative comments creating a negative environment - I will remove them.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel like I am a great candidate.  I know how the site works.  I am fair and unbiased.  I am dedicated to making this site a success.  I am also willing to listen.</p>

<p>Ever since I could access my first review queue, I enjoyed spending time moderating this site. As my knowledge and privileges increased, so did the time I spend and the amount of tasks I perform and now I'd like to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>Why me?</p>

<ul>
<li>I enjoy completing review tasks, even if they seem ""monotonous"". For example, I reviewed <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/search?q=feedback&amp;user=3002139&amp;room=111347"">over 12k</a> ""NATOs"".</li>
<li>I work closely with Bhargav Rao on the SOBotics project, which I think has given me a good idea about the tasks of moderators.</li>
<li>When I get feedback indicating I'm doing something wrong, I make it a priority to fix that problem before I get back to the task at hand, yielding a high accuracy in my moderator actions in the past. (E.g: 9.8k helpful flags, 15 declined, no auto-flags; ~11k review tasks without any review bans.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not me?</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't post much on Meta, although I do read important discussions; I'm mostly expressing my opinion through votes instead.</li>

<p>Why I would be a good moderator</p>

<ul>
<li>I spend several hours on SO daily. Dedicating 30 minutes and more a day is easily possible. I have 1388 answers vs. 13 questions. I don't answer nearly as often now, preferring to close questions when possible.. I still log in almost every single day (missed maybe 7 days in a year while travelling), and will be around more often than not.</li>
<li>Since I hit 10k, I've made good use of the tools given to me and raised over 2000 helpful flags.</li>
<li>My meta participation is a bit low, but I'm working on improving that.</li>
<li>I'm very even headed. If you ever drops by the Android chat room, or goes over its transcripts, you'll find that in my role as room owner I'm always fair in my decisions and don't pick fights with anyone at all.</li>
<li>I'm patient and willing to help. In many cases I go to great lengths to help out people, explaining over a few comments or on chat how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>My timezone allows me to be active when USA mods aren't which can be very helpful right now.</li>

<ul>
<li>No prior moderating experience except some edits and closing and flagging done here on SO</li>
<li>I don't have much flagging count to my name but that's largely because I'm much more active on giving answers on SO. That's also the reason for why I'm not active on MSO.</li>

<p>Responsibilities inspire me, so I'd love the chance to become the mod and will do my best to keep SO clean. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>To moderate for quality and to lower that huge Close Vote section under review. Spam questions get deleted in the blink of an eye, but I'll take looks at those, too.</p></li>

<p>I've been here a while and have seen Stack Overflow grow from its beta stage to fulfilling its declared goal of being the de facto standard place to find solutions for programming problems. It has absolutely revolutionised this little corner of the internet, and it is truly important to preserve it and its original goal of being a knowledge base for everyone. There truly is no viable alternative anywhere close, Stack Overflow has become an institution almost inseparable from the profession of programming at this point in time.</p>

<p>Through the years I've witnessed the ups and downs and policy changes the site went through, and I'm pretty optimistic about the current relatively stable state the community has reached. The overall mood is generally productive, and although there's a constant need for moderation, this is typically happening smoothly and efficiently. I'd like to help keep it that way and keep improving and tweaking the formula wherever possible and necessary.</p>

<p>My name is <em>Sergey K.</em>, and I would like to nominate myself.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was not even thinking of nominating myself as a moderator. I thought my SO profile was too weak (&lt;20K rep, lack of some badges). However, today I realized I need only 1 more badge to take part in the elections. It turned out that to get that badge I needed only 1 more good post on <em>meta</em>. Well...Now I’m writing this text and, <strong>regardless of the outcome,</strong> I want to take part in these elections. </p>

<p><strong>My USPs</strong></p>

<p>I would be a good moderator because during the last 2 years SO had a viral attraction on me. 
I enjoy SO and I extensively edit and review posts here. I enjoy making this site cleaner. The moderator duties will not be something new to me.  <strong>I really want to help them out.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why Not Me?</strong></p>

<p>I contribute every day (currently 600+ consecutive days) answering questions (5K+ answers) and helping others refine theirs.</p>

<p>So, why me?</p>

<ul>
<li>I won't tolerate any racist, sexist, bullying (especially of newbies) or other forms of impoliteness. Disagree with others for sure, but respect and civility must be maintained at all times (and some humor is good too!)</li>
<li>Like good code, answers and especially questions should be a brief as possible (without losing meaning or legibility). Reflect that <strong>we're building a knowledge base here, not a blog site</strong>. I will guide users to this end</li>
<li>Migration to other forums is another bugbear of mine. Often there are questions that are good questions, but belong elsewhere. I'll do my best to migrate them appropriately</li>
<li>I'll turn up every day and do the job</li>

<p>TL;DR: A vote for me is a vote for quality and an extra janitor.</p>

<h2>Why mod?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm very active on meta. I'm also active in <a href=""http://is.gd/m3m2A"" rel=""nofollow"">its chat</a>, the Tavern. I already have experience in moderation, as I discuss it often.</p></li>
<li><p>I also have <em>practical</em> mod experience. I have 20k rep, the highest level before mod, and the main reason I have as much is to moderate. Usually when I browse SO, it's to <strong>close, comment, edit, and delete,</strong> and I do this almost daily.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm extremely dedicated to keeping the quality of the site clean, and that's pretty much the only reason I want to be a mod. Not many people know this, but I've played a major part in fighting the recent spam. I even made a script that posts in the Tavern when spam is detected.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Main goals if elected</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Moderate the quality of posts. I'll be careful with binding votes, using comments more often, but I still want to make SO a better place.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower that huge flag and close queue! I've been enjoying @animuson's flag/close campaigns in the Tavern, and I'd like to help in that area more.</p></li>
<li><p>Review ban ALL the robo-reviewers! I've noticed quite a bit of them, and I want to make them stop filling SO with terribleness.</p></li>

<li><p>I like getting rid of bad questions and answers. In fact I've flagged probably over 200 NAA answers and have had them deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>I'd like to help out closing and leaving open questions in the CV queue more. I'd like to help the Close Vote queue by closing bad questions and keeping good ones open.</p></li>
<li><p>I like to get rid of obsolete and too chatty comments. In fact, Undo, ManishEarth and I have generated a tool to get rid of these comments. Being a mod would make me be able to get rid of these comments without mass-flagging, and more than 100 a day.</p></li>

<li>Active community member for nearly 2 years, with a solid feel for how SO works, including the do's and dont's, the types of behaviour that will get you liked, and conversely the types of behaviour that will result in people thinking you're a douch.</li>
<li>I always try to <em>do the right thing</em>. I'm not saying I always get it right, but I do try.</li>
<li>I politely thank people for pointing out my mistakes, rather than excusing myself or pretending they are not there.</li>
<li>I try to stick up for people who are clearly surrounded by wolves, when the need arises.</li>
<li>Badges I've earned which are relevant to moderation include: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/70393/karim79"">Electorate, Pundit, Epic, Fanatic, Disciplined, Strunk &amp; White, Generalist (phew!) and possibly more.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other potentially voteworthy qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>I try to vote on several <em>good answers</em> per thread. My logic: 1) First correct solution. 2) Second (if posted within a few seconds) 3) Any detailed/prolific investigation provided it is original. 4) Anything else that is helpful in some way and <em>adds value</em> to the thread.</li>
<li>I edit answers posted by newbies which have been unfairly neglected due to their lack of formatting or broken English, and vote those answers up as a motivational kick to said newbie in the hope that they will stick around.</li>
<li>I have stopped down-voting. I can't remember the last time I cast one. I don't know whether this is a good or bad thing to be honest. The number of down-votes I have casted will forever remain at 326.</li>
<li>My interest in quite a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/70393/karim79"">broad range of disciplines</a> means that I'll be checking out heck of a lot of the content being posted - and applying the, erm, Iron Diamond where necessary.</li>
<li>StackOverflow gets its very own 24 inch
flatscreen, both at the office and at
home.</li>
<li>When I am on the computer,
StackOverflow is on the computer.</li>

<p>I despise writing about myself. However, I feel compelled to do so since this self-nomination initially read just ""I was born to moderate"", which true as it may be (;p), as the first commenter points out, is probably not a very good reason.</p>

<p>I've been following Stack Overflow literally from before its beginning (6-8 anyone?). Within the first year or so of its existence it became quite a major point of influence for me. I've learned and grown from it in my professional career enormously. And while I'm still learning from it, at some point my interaction with Stack Overflow tipped over into me ""putting in"" more than ""getting out"". I like the community, the site, the interaction model. It works. It accomplishes its design goal each and every day. My personal experience with it is all the proof I need for that.</p>

<p>Since my interaction with the community has become more and more meta over time, nominating myself for moderator seems like the logical next step. I'm often mostly curating the site with the few tools I have available anyway; if you think I'm doing a decent job at that and would be okay with giving me access to more tools, I'd be happy to wield them.</p>

<p>Some quick third-person facts about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>is mostly active in LAMP-stack related tags from PHP over Python, MySQL, Postgres, Javascript to AngularJS</li>
<li>has somehow managed to visit the site every day, even while his son was born</li>
<li>has problems with character limi</li>

<p>Hello, I'm Magisch. I'm 22 Years old and currently in an Apprenticeship to become a Software Dev. I started this in Fall 2015, which is also when I joined Stack Overflow. Since then, SO has become most essential to both my education and leisure time. Other then my Apprenticeship, I have no other commitments in life at the moment.</p>

<p>I also participate in community projects to help keep the site clean - like SmokeDetector and SOCVR.</p>

<p>Something that may immediately come to mind is: Why me? Why, among all the great candidates, would you vote for me?  I believe that I have the skills to make a difference, and I certainly have the time.  </p>

<p>What I can offer to the community:</p>

<li><p>Pretty much 4-6 hours a day, all but guaranteed to continue and hold for at least the next 3-4 years</p></li>
<li><p>Experience in moderation: I've been part of many projects as moderator, including minecraftforum.net </p></li>
<li><p>I really enjoy handling flags and review queues. I also oh so enjoy nuking spam and finding plagiarism. Moderation has pretty much made up most of my SO activity.</p></li>

<p>I'd like to think I would be a very light handed moderator. Quick to remove obvious abuses, but in more nuanced problems I'm able to see both sides of the story. </p>

<p>I have a great deal of experience with such diplomacy - I helped to run a website called Geograph.org.uk, which collects geographical photographs of the UK. I handled all of the complaints raised by landowners concerned about photographs, some of whom were irate, threatening and abusive. I would adjudicate with calm, measured communications: sometimes siding with the photographer, sometimes with the landowner, but almost always to satisfaction of both parties. In some cases, I even turned infuriated correspondents into active site contributors!</p>

<p>Where Stack Overflow is concerned, I'm always mindful that we should be producing a body of work that 'gives good Google', in that we're not just helping an individual with his problem, but trying to ensure those who come later with the same question are delighted to find the answers they seek.</p>

<p>I visit StackOverflow daily and am part of the <a href=""http://bit.ly/ZEQZi8"" rel=""nofollow"">cv-ring</a>; pruning the PHP tag of dupes and low quality stuff. I have helped to close more than 3200 questions. Becoming a moderator would allow me to extend my daily routine to handling flags. So I can better support you, the mods and StackOverflow as a whole in <a href=""http://bit.ly/X6TQxO"" rel=""nofollow"">keeping the PHP tag tidy</a>. </p>

<p>I am aware that being a mod would extend my duties beyond the PHP tag. I understand the Theory of Moderation and that being a mod is not about closing as much as possible. As a mod, I will simply keep closevoting as I do now (unless it's a really obvious case) and focus on helping my fellow mods with the flags.</p>

<p>I have my fair share of experience on the site, with over 800 answers, and 60 questions.</p>

<p>Having visited the site for nearly 425 days straight now, I feel like I can dedicate substantial time to moderation of tags in which I am knowledgeable.</p>

<p>I feel like the one of the things that the current moderation crew lacks is a lack of users competent in certain tags, leading to flags which should have been accepted rejected, and vice versa. Specifically, when dealing with low quality iOS posts. I feel like I could step in and somewhat 'fill in the gaps' in those areas, and be a positive influence in that regard.</p>

<p>One thing that I would like to disclose now, which may worry some people is that I am only 16. However, despite one <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/140444"">incident</a>, I feel like I have maintained a professional relationship with the website.</p>

<p>I've been a member for over three years - actively for the past two - and have benefited from the way this site is operated so much that I feel inspired to assist in its moderation. As a user with over 9000 helpful flags (and about 90 declined) I think it's about time I switch from giving the moderators more work to do, and instead start helping them do it!</p>

<h2>Why Moderators?</h2>

<p>Moderators are here to make those 'judgment calls' for which automated or purely community-based systems are not up to the task; to be the 'janitors', as the blog post says. I feel this is very important, and would take it very seriously. I always look over my flag summary to see if I've had any flags declined, which has been a steadily-decreasing occurrence the more involved and experienced I become with how the community wants the site to operate. This helps hone my skills.</p>

<li><strong>I grok the Theory of Moderation.</strong> As error handlers, mods must use a light touch. We step in if there's a problem only mods can fix or a problem in the community itself, not if the community is handling things on its own.</li>
<li><strong>I treat everyone with respect and help new users.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I do tons of quality control and cleanup.</strong> I've raised over 8,900 flags (99.36% helpful).</li>
<li><strong>I work the review queues.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I know my limits.</strong> I don't moderate what I don't understand; I get help.</li>
<li><strong>I'm on here <em>all the time.</em></strong></li>

<p>I'm ArtOfCode, usually known as Art because capitalization is hard. I'm a British computer science student. I've dabbled in a number of technologies across various platforms, but today most of what I do is either in Python or Rails.</p>

<h2>...and you're running because?</h2>

<p>Because I enjoy moderation. On the regular-user side, I'm part of the <a href=""http://charcoal-se.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Charcoal</a> team (who are responsible for the spam-detection bot, SmokeDetector) which lets me do the janitorial work in cleaning up spam; I drop into SOCVR occasionally to see if there's anything that needs some helping hands. I also regularly run through some reviews (though my review counts aren't as high as I'd like).</p>

<p>I also have diamonds on two other sites in the SE network, Hardware Recommendations and Open Source, where I enjoy the diamond-side of moderation. While user-side janitorial work is important, I find it rewarding to be able to process the moderator side of that too.</p>

<p><strong>Brief Intro</strong></p>

<p>My name is Siddharth Rout &amp; I would like to nominate myself.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow is always open with 2 other sites on my firefox tabs. If I am not answering new questions, I would probably be visiting old questions/comments &amp; answering/editing/retagging/flagging them or clearing the queues.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons Why I feel that I can be a Stack Overflow mod</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I'm already a mod in vbforums &amp; msdn. So the concept of moderation isn't new to me &amp; I come with relevant expertise which is required for moderation</li>
<li>I work from home so I've enough time on my hands to devote to moderation. Especially on weekends. (TimeZone: UTC + 05:30)</li>
<li>I'm very friendly, approachable &amp; a fast learner besides being a good team player.</li>

<p><strong>What would be my main focus if I become a mod</strong></p>

<p>My main focus will <strong>NOT</strong> be to clear the mod queues or perform a specific mod duty like opening/closing questions etc. These duties come ""<strong>As Is</strong>"" when one becomes a mod &amp; one has to do them.</p>

<p>My <strong>special agenda</strong> would be to make Stack Overflow a more welcoming place for new users.

<li>I'm very even headed. If anyone ever drops by the Android chat room, or goes over its transcripts, they will find that in my role as room owner I am always fair in my decisions and don't pick fights with anyone at all.</li>

<hr>

<p>Hello, my name is Martijn Pieters and I am a Stack Overflow Ninja.</p>

<p>I've been <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/100297"">active on Meta</a> since <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/140890"">before we had our own Meta</a>; you may have seen me active there <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/support/topusers"">providing support</a>. As such I am already devoting quite some time to help run this place, next to my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python/topusers"">other Stack Overflow activities</a>.</p>

<p>And I am addicted to it. I ask you to help me <em>feed</em> this addiction, and elect me moderator so that I can help more, clean up more, support more.</p>

<p>I've always been the quiet admin in the background, gardening the system and keeping out the cruft, the garbage and the critters. I've been a moderator of various groups, forums and bulletin board sites, and I've naturally extended this to Stack Overflow. I <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters?tab=activity"">edit almost any question I open</a>, resulting in a <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/228741"" rel=""nofollow"">top illuminator spot</a> and better questions. </p>

<p>Make me mod, and I'll extend that drive to the flag queue!</p>",119,2015-04-06 21:07:14.203000+00:00,2015-04-06 21:07:14.203000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:32:04.247000+00:00,2015-04-17 19:32:04.247000+00:00,,811,,100297,6,10817,
8051161,"<p>I am trying to get to the moderator position, because I consider myself a tolerant and patient person with a lot of free time, always trying to do my best when helping people. </p>

<p>I know that everyone make mistakes, that everyone is better in specific areas. I can also accept critique and I'm able to accept my fault.</p>

<p>If I would have to deal with people defending with an incorrect opinion, I would tolerantly explain why they're wrong by providing objective arguments and/or evidence to support my case.</p>

<p>I'm experienced in the Stack Overflow system a lot, even though I've only been registered for a short time.</p>

<p>I report bugs most times, for example <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/106002/flagging-a-post-before-submitting-the-5th-close-vote-always-results-in-flag-bein"">this one</a> which would be an easy way to get free flag weight.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, I have a few denied flags, (1624 helpful, 67 disputed (mainly flagged invalid flags), 28 unhelpful) which means that I have only 98.19 % of accepted/disputed flags but I still think it's pretty fair. My current flag weight is 737, (lost 2 flags (20 points) in a very short time)</p>

<p>Yes, I know, my English isn't perfect, I am trying to improve it as fast as possible, but I also don't think that's the main aspect of moderation requirement, though I know it's a requirement to be understandable and communicative, which I am. </p>

<p>I wish I could get into the moderator position and be even more active than I'm currently and make Stack Overflow even better place for all programmers around the whole world.</p>

<p>I'm quite active on meta and trying to do my best when answering both good and bad questions.</p>

<p>I will be always there for Stack Exchange network, and I also want to show to everyone that even a young person can do big things.</p>

<p>I'm young active PHP programmer and Facebook enthusiast which aims to the skies.</p>

<p>Please, do not consider your ""vote"" based on my age, I know that I am young, but I think I can handle this position.</p>",125,2011-11-08 13:31:05.033000+00:00,2011-11-08 13:31:05.033000+00:00,2011-11-11 17:21:34.100000+00:00,2014-04-25 09:44:10.137000+00:00,,-1,,764846,6,-37,
21687077,"<p>I am H2CO3, and I'd like to nominate myself for a community moderator position.</p>

<h2>Why would I make a good moderator?</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I dedicate several hours (if possible) of my time to Stack Overflow daily. I think I comfortably fulfill the required amount of contribution (30 minutes per day). I've been a member for more than 3 years now.</p></li>
<li><p>I have a pretty good sense of quality, and I believe that the overall quality standard of Stack Overflow should stay as high as possible. This makes us different from forums and other Q&amp;A sites. I usually edit and comment on posts in this spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm very enthusiastic – I've been preparing and improving this application continuously since August 2013.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Why would it be good for the community?</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I have experience with C and Objective-C (iOS) programming, and I'm very actively participating in these tags, so I can do pretty good work cleaning related questions, answers and comments.</p></li>
<li><p>THERE WOULD BE LESS ALL CAPS</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's a personal goal and challenge for me, too. After all, it would just feel good to be one of the people who take an even bigger part in running Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>To elect or not to elect? You decide. :-)</p>",108,2014-02-10 20:17:56.597000+00:00,2014-02-10 20:17:56.597000+00:00,2014-02-10 20:17:56.597000+00:00,2014-02-10 20:17:56.597000+00:00,user529758,,user529758,,6,0,

I have not seen any of my Stack Overflow tag-related friends yet running in this election so I thought why not give it a go.

There is about 5-10 of us who are active on a day to day basis and do our best to keep our little favorite sector of Stack Overflow happy and well moderated. Only if we all could become mods that would be awesome as we do seem to agree in most moderation-related cases. Instead of summarizing all the goods or bads (yep no one is perfect) I'd like you to rather visit my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/2140173/mehow"">SO</a>, META, and Careers profiles for details. I spend ~30 hrs/wk here and could use a few of those towards some more responsible tasks.</p>",2,2014-02-10 22:51:28.980000+00:00,2014-02-10 22:51:28.980000+00:00,2014-02-10 23:14:09.887000+00:00,2014-02-10 23:14:09.887000+00:00,user2140173,,user2140173,,6,0,
