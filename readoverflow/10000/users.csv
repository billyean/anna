<p>Reason !</p>

<ol>
<li>Did not get enough automation project opportunities </li>
<li>Most of the study material available is not that simple that i could relate with examples.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on this common struggles , few of us got together to start a website , in which we have tried to put our knowledge in a explanatory way.</p>

<p>if your intrested to learn automation , you can have a look into it. We have started with mobile automation topic.</p>

<p>if you like, you can share. </p>

<p>If it helps, we would be happy.</p>

<p>My aim is to further my experience in the IT industry and help others achieve their goals through this and eventually start my own business officially. </p>

<p>I am still currently studying as a student at Vision College until June 2012. I am doing a diploma in WWW Page Programming and Design (Web design), so any experience that could help me further in this course would be incredible.</p>

<p>I am half way through the course and have learnt quite a bit about HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Graphic Design. In this second half of my course I am starting to learn about Databases, SQL, ASP.NET and general E-commerce. </p>

<p>I enjoy learning more about the topics outside of school and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m constantly going through many different coursd learning as much as I can.</p>

<p>One thing I really enjoy doing is looking at someone elseï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ code and trying to work out what goes with what and what makes it tick.</p>

<p>I also have quite a bit of experience in building websites using CMS solutions. Mainly using Wordpress which is implemented in many of the sites I maintain currently.</p>

The long, cold, and dark winters are prime time to sit in front of a screen and develop new skills. Though in summer, I'm more likely to enjoy the midnight sun and great outdoors. </p>

<p>My current work generally involves more about geochemistry and wildlife geography than programming, but I'm interested in a wide array of different languages and platforms. However, I spend most of my time on Stack Overflow on the geographic side of things along with a focus on d3.js. </p>

<p>In addition to a few geographic oriented d3 extensions that are slowly evolving, I'm also working on a visualization utility (for use with D3) called <a href=""https://github.com/Andrew-Reid/lichen.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lichen</a> that allows easy integration of patterns and textures with svg shapes.

114623,Pascal Bourque,"<p>I have been passionate about programming since I was 11, always craving to learn new skills. Badgering my dad for months to buy the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_Extended_BASIC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TI Extended BASIC</a> cartridge for my TI-99/4A was the beginning of a long and addictive foray into computers, programming, and all-around geekiness.</p>

<p>I am a fast learner, not afraid of jumping mind wide open into any unknown language, framework or OS and ingest every bit of information there is. To me, knowing how is not enough: I need to understand why. This gives me great insight into the languages and frameworks I choose to use.</p>

<p>I am perfectionist by nature and take pride in work well done. I also like to ship products, which puts me in the pragmatic subspecies of perfectionists.</p>

<p>As a team leader, I believe that fluid communication is the basis of any functional team and project. I deeply care that every team member is on the same page and knows what part they are playing in the project. I also strongly believe that mutual respect is essential for a team to be strong.</p>

<p>I am still passionate about my craft after doing it professionally for 18 years, and I don't see an end to that enthusiasm as long as I keep facing interesting challenges.</p>",,2009-05-30 00:29:29.540000+00:00,2018-11-30 19:57:54.183000+00:00,"Ste.-Julie, QC, Canada",3881,308,14,250,https://i.stack.imgur.com/SIugT.jpg?s=128&g=1,

I am a big fan of Android Studio, Gradle and other hot Android open source projects in GitHub such as RxJava, Dagger, Retrofit and so on. I am familiar with Server Framework such as Spring, Hibernate, Struts and Servlet and experienced in developing Backend service API. In regarding to my personality, I believe that a man should not only take responsibility but also honor in his job and as a human being, the most invaluable merits that a man could possess are exactly the nature of a powerful robot, which are stability, reliability &amp; predictability.</p>",,2014-09-23 04:22:42.593000+00:00,2018-12-02 04:20:43.663000+00:00,"Pittsburgh, PA",126,31,0,33,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iRb7TLyiEWI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACU/hBuOlkUDIaQ/photo.jpg?sz=128,http://www.ancopy.io

<p>I have many strengths, but I take a particular interest in Web Design. I have so far created 3 major websites, and 3 personal project websites.</p>

<p>The 3 major websites:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href=""https://www.sjndesigns.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.sjndesigns.co.uk</a> - My non-trading web design business website</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3 personal project websites:</p>

<ul>

<p>As a primarily autodidactic programmer, I have developed skills to quickly and effectively teach myself new concepts. Considering the intense speed at which technology is progressing, the ability to educate oneself and apply new skills to technological and creative challenges is one of a developerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most valuable assets.</p>

<p>Even though the creation of software, at its core, is the act of providing a solution to a problem, the manner in which that solution is presented to the user is paramount. It is in this context I feel my analytical and problem solving skills to be most useful. The importance of the userï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s experience cannot be overstated in todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s consumer-facing technology market. For software to be truly successful, it must not only provide a brilliant solution to a problem, but also do so with elegance, and inherent ease of use.</p>

<p>The future of the software industry lies at the interanities and technology, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.</p>",,2014-04-29 07:59:28.133000+00:00,2018-05-24 07:19:58.037000+00:00,Indore,94,2,0,29,https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Q1wF.jpg,

<p>My first language was Basic and I'm most comfortable in that family of languages (VB, VBA, VBS, PL/1, Pascal, Cobol, SQR, SQL) but for the past few years, I've been reaching out of my comfort zone into C, Java, and Objective-C mainly because I want to write my own apps on iPhone and iPad.  This site has been so awesome and I appreciate all the folks that get on here and answer stuff.  I also appreciate all the folks that ask stuff because it seems I don't have to ask it - already been asked and I can glean my answers from those questions.</p>

<p>Now I'm getting back into VB through VB.NET and it has been such a relief because I actually know this stuff.  All the learning of OOP has helped tremendously in understanding the new (to me) version of VB!</p>

I stayed working in software and ERP systems development, and later consulting and Project management. I earned a Master's Degree in Project Management and hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information systems. I am also PMP and CSM certified. </p>

<p>In my 2.0 Phase, I am Java, .NET and c, c++, c#, JavaScript, Objective c, and Xcode guy, I work as a .NET web developer and I am in school continuing my education in pursuit of a Master's Degree in Computer Science. </p>

<p>So, I may ask questions that are work related, and questions that are school related and I hope that I am in the position to pay it forward to someone else in need!!

1016343,Matt,"<p>I am an application engineer with a German Diplom (university degree) in computer science<sup>*)</sup> working in international projects as technical lead, developing web and Windows applications as well as web and Windows services for the .NET Framework based on Microsoft technology.</p>

<p>My main development platform is Visual Studio with Team Foundation Server, and I am working with C#, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, LINQ, Entity Framework etc. I am also very interested in efficient algorithms of all kinds, cryptography, multithreading, tips &amp; tricks ...</p>

<p>In my opinion, StackOverflow is a great platform to exchange knowlege like this and I found many tips there, which is why I am always very motivated to give back knowlege by answering questions where I can.</p>

<p><sup>*) Note: According to wikipedia, the German Diplom is comparable with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in one (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom</a>).</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>Some <strong>hints and tips</strong> around Stack Exchange: <br/></p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search"">https://stackoverflow.com/search</a>, click on ""Advanced..."" to show options</li>
<li>Search within your favorites: Enter <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3683/search-in-favorited-questions/161053#161053""><code>infavorites:mine search_expression</code></a></li>
<li>Search within your posts related to a tag. For example: <code>user:mine [C#]</code> finds everything you have posted that is related to C#.</li>
<li>Run SQL queries against stack overflow posts: check <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-cc-data-now-hosted-by-the-internet-archive/"">this</a> out to download an archive and <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://data.stackexchange.com/</a> to run SQL queries against current stack exchange sites</li>
<li>Use keyboard tags, e.g. <code>&lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;</code> appears as <kbd>Alt</kbd></li>
<li>If necessary, add line breaks with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> <sup>*)</sup></li>
<li>Syntax highlighting in your posts - Use a tag like: <br/><code>&lt;!-- language-all: lang-cs --&gt;</code><br/>For available tags, see: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/AWMtu5rK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a> and <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/72082/changes-to-syntax-highlighting"">that link</a> (meta)</li>
<li>Version tags: Use them to mark pre-C#6: <code>&lt;!-- if version [lt 6.0] --&gt;</code></li>
<li>To add runnable CSS/HTML/JavaScript code, use the code sample icon <code>{}</code> when editing your question rather than providing a <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JsFiddle</a> link (but JsFiddle is good for testing). <br/>If you want to add runnable .NET code (C#, F# or VB.NET), you can create it in <a href=""https://dotnetfiddle.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DotNetFiddle</a> and add a link (please provide the code in SO too because the link might become unusable). For screenshots you can use the free tool <a href=""http://www.screentogif.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.screentogif.com/</a><br/></li>
<li><strong>Hide answers:</strong> use <code>&gt;!</code>, like so (point with the mouse):
<br/> <em>What is the answer to the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ultimate question</a>?</em></strong> 

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The answer is <strong>42</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><sup>*) use <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> for superscript/subscript</sup></p>

  <p>Most programs are too complicated ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that is, more complex than they need to be to solve their problems efficiently. Why? Mostly itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s because of bad design, but I will skip that issue here because itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a big one. But programs are often complicated at the microscopic level, and that is something I can address here.  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Rule 1.</strong>  You canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t tell where a program is going to spend its time.  Bottlenecks occur in surprising
  places, so donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve proven thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s where the bottleneck
  is.  </li>
  <li><strong>Rule 2.</strong>  Measure.  Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t tune for speed until youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve measured, and even then donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.</li>
  <li><strong>Rule 3.</strong>  Fancy algorithms are slow when <em>n</em> is small, and <em>n</em> is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that <em>n</em> isdoes get big, use Rule 2 first.)  For example, binary trees are always faster than splay trees for workaday problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Rule 4.</strong>  Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re much harder to implement.  Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.<br>
  The following data structures are a complete list for almost all practical programs: array, linked list, hash table, binary tree.<br>
  Of course, you must also be prepared to collect these into compound data structures.  For instance, a symbol table might be implemented as a hash table containing linked lists of arrays of characters.</li>
  <li><strong>Rule 5.</strong>  Data dominates.  If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve chosen the right data structures and organized  things well, the
  algorithms will almost always be self-evident.  Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
  (See Brooks p. 102.)</li>
  <li><strong>Rule 6.</strong>  There is no Rule 6.</li>
  </ul>

5064,James Clarke,"<p>I work as a software engineer for a company that, amongst other things, makes mobile phone software. I have worked in several teams working on Android apps. I currently work on processing large amounts of app telemetry data in the cloud, using things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spark, Hive, Hadoop</li>
<li>AWS, Azure</li>
<li>Java, Python, Kotlin, Scala, SQL, and maybe even a little Clojure.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do some of these things, I like to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>GNU/Linux, particularly Arch with i3</li>
<li>A lot of Emacs, a bit of Vim, quite a bit of Intellij</li>
<li>git and GitHub</li>
<li>good old command line tools, including sed, awk, grep</li>
</ul>

<p>In a previous job, I worked for a company that made mobile phones, working on a smartphone operating system. Don't look for it. It's not there anymore. When it was, I did systems programming in C++, working on a number of different operating system components/subsystems.</p>

<p>Before that, I had a job as a researcher in a university where I first worked processing data, and learned to program and to make databases and websites.</p>",,2008-09-07 16:59:43.857000+00:00,2018-11-30 15:44:28.997000+00:00,"London, England United Kingdom",71,5,0,103,,

Within the software engineering realm, I'm most interested in design patterns, techniques, theories, and language features that make software systems easiest to develop, maintain, and support.  My key interest of late is strongly typed functional languages (such as Haskell and Scala) for all the benefits they seem to provide the developer without causing much of a performance hit.  I work in the nitty-gritty often in my day job, but my preference is to understand things well at the most general and abstract levels of programming to apply solutions more broadly.</p>

<p>Outside of software, I have varied interests.  The chief among them is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, so you will find me fairly active on the Christianity SE site.

<p>I've been programming since the day I first unboxed my first computer - an Atari 130XE.

Every day, I try to learn and apply new skills, everything from development languages to psychology of human interaction. I often find myself in a jack-of-all-trades position, bringing together the specialists in a company to collaborate and work together better. Coming up with creative solutions to complex problems is fun to me, and I often do it proactively, without being asked.</p>

5613,Marshall Kirkpatrick,"I am working on a research report about the technologies  categorized as the real-time web.  So far I've spoken with 45+ different companies building or leveraging real-time technologies like PubSubHubbub, XMPP, Twitter, etc.  My co-workers at ReadWriteWeb and I also hosted an event on the topic in Mountain View, CA in October.
</p><p>
I am not a developer but I admire what cutting edge developers do. Our site attempts to translate some of that in news coverage for end users.
</p><p>
I think StackOverflow might be a good place to find developers interested in suggesting some technical questions that I could ask the companies I'm profiling as case studies in the report I'm writing.  I'm writing the report primarily regarding things like obstacles faced, lessons learned and value propositions articulated regarding the use of real-time technologies.  
</p><p>
I'm posting drafts of my write-ups here and asking StackOverflow users to suggest questions you'd like to see the answers to, questions that presumably will be more technical than what I've asked.  If I use one of your questions in the report, I'll contact you here and send you a copy of the full report when it's done at no cost.

3533188,Farshid PirahanSiah,"<p>My interests span a wide range of avenues in Computer Vision and Machine Learning (Deep Learning). I have been working on computer vision during my masters and PhD programs. Currently, I am senior researcher at MIMOS Berhad (Malaysia's national R&amp;D center in ICT) in area of computer vision, deep learning, and video analysis. I have designed and developed algorithms and applications for license plate recognition systems in my master research. In my PhD (with five semesters scholarship), I continued working on computer vision and robotics (camera calibration, image pyramid, optical flow, video stabilization, robot localization, and Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems). I was teaching assistant for several courses such as, OpenCV, Computer Vision, intelligent systems and research tools. In addition, laboratory teaching assistant for artificial intelligent system. Moreover, I have conducted workshops in image processing, research tools, and hands-on workshops in deep neural networks for computer vision. I also have excellent software engineering skills, with emphasis on C++ and OpenCV.
I also have made several tutorials in area of computer vision and deep learning.

<p>I'm currently learning how to speak/read/write Japanese. I'm also a part-time film director and actor, which I started doing in 2001. Starting sometime in 2018 I'll be making YouTube videos. They'll be about web design, computer languages and programming, as well as video games, books, movies, anime, retro, cool facts, random thoughts, and the occasional comedy skit. I use both Apple and Windows operating systems. My favorite is Windows 95.</p>

<p>I started doing web design in May 2013. These are programming languages that I have learned HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, XML, JSON, AJAX, SQL, MySQL, SMIL, WPL and C++. I know how to use PhotoShop, Illustrator, Premier, After Effects, and InDesign.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on recreating classic video games from Nintendo, Sega, Namco, Atari, etc. in JavaScript. The ones that I'm working on right now are Super Mario Bros. 1, Pac-Man, and Minesweeper (typical). After those are finished I'll create Super Mario Bros. 3, Asteroids, and Duck Hunt. Plenty more will come after that (like NES Gold, and possibly the 1st Zelda).</p>

<p>Been using mostly Microsoft stuff for the last 10 years or so, extensive C# and MS-SQL experience, and a whole ton of Bourne (Again) Shell scripts to do just about anything you can think of.</p>

<p>My first major development package was in IPC using Mailboxes (think pipes) on VAX/VMS. Second major development package was a parser written for the same platform. Both of these were written in FORTRAN-77 (UGH!), but the latter was later converted to C, and even eventually to C#.</p>",,2012-07-24 15:25:02.563000+00:00,2018-11-20 20:01:32.327000+00:00,"Indianapolis, IN, USA",829,65,2,73,https://i.stack.imgur.com/NHTor.jpg,http://sports-gazer.com

Main fields of interest are programming, mathematical modelling and computer science.</p>

<p>I gained experience in math modelling of biped walking. Study grid computing, big data, middleware and experienced in parallel computing, cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS...). </p>

<p>My current job involves the development of an electronic circuit simulator (Research &amp; Development), extending its math functionality using various numerical methods, signal processing and upgrade software architecture with C/C++ &amp; Python. Development on Windows/Linux. Working with Boost C++(Unit tests, threads, filesystem, Python...), OpenMP, various Python Math libriaries: numpy, scipy, sklearn, CMake, gcc/msvc. </p>

<p>Experienced in using containers (docker, nvidia-docker) and deploying various projects with Heroku.
Had commercial projects involving developing CNNs for image classification/segmentation. </p>

<p>In free time I work on some non-commercial projects with speech/sound recognition involving HMM. Like reading books mostly about programming or algoritms and articles about ML, signal processing. Working mostly with Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora).</p>",,2016-11-30 20:31:25.433000+00:00,2018-11-17 11:39:27.467000+00:00,"Saint Petersburg, Russia",177,45,6,37,https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bnexn.png?s=128&g=1,

<p>Been in love with development since before I even knew what development was. Proud terrapin from the University of Maryland with a BS and MS in Computer/Electrical Engineering.</p>

<p>The only other thing that I let keep me up as late as programming (and usually longer) is gaming. Lifelong gamer: video games, board games, card gamesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Single-player and multi-player. Competitive and cooperative. Casual and hardcore.</p>

<p>Eager and excited to meet and knock heads with all the wonderfully cool and awesomely smart developers and designers out there. And hopefully I'll be able to show y'all a cool thing or two of mine.</p>

English and Japanese are not my native languages, so I need your help.<br>
My friends, my parents, my sisters, they all tell me that I am just too slim, so I want to learn how to swim, I want to be healthier and stronger.<br>
I like Japanese anime and music. <br>
I am playing sailormoon in Gameboy, and sometimes enjoy watching people playing the King of Fighters XIII on Youtube.<br>
Please don't be mistaken, I am not any Tomboy.
A few days ago when I was chatting with the user, Man_from_India, I told him that My grandpa is Chinese, and Grandma is Thai, my mother is Australian, and Auntie Mizuki is Japanese. 
I am so confused of what my native language is, because I don't know how to speak Thai or Japanese or Chinese. I can read some simple Chinese characters though.
Thanks to Man_From_India, you should know something about me now. Hehehehe...
Thank you for your reading. XD

It's been about a couple of years since then and eventually, I have been immensely interested by this thing called programming. I would -and still- search the whole Internet for even the slightest doubt at any part of a code and finally decided to sign up for stack overflow to make that easier. I would like to specialize in this field for my higher studies.</p>",,2016-01-31 10:23:56.950000+00:00,2018-11-04 16:15:54.403000+00:00,,45,4,0,32,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ef4bcbad30e334126c92947513a04af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,

263762,csharpforevermore,"<p>Well - right now I am at around a decade of working with Microsoft products and I've been developing commercially with Visual Studio in some form for nearly all of that, in some shape or form.  I started with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and moved onto VB.NET, then C#.  I've also done coding in everything from Pascal, Delphi and C++ through to PHP.</p>

<p>Before all of that, I used to code on the Acorn Electron (a variant of the BBC Micro's BASIC was the language of choice there). My earliest years (aged 6) involved getting out of bed at night to type out the code shown in the books, and this proved to be my right of passage.</p>

<p>I currently web development and coding for a living using various Content Management Systems - a job which is a brilliant job to do. More importantly I can afford to eat. Always a bonus.</p>

<p>I live to code and code to live, because I feel it gives me an ""artistic"" outlet, whereby it provides me with a creative outlet. I guess it's the same way that many people find it is fun to solve crossword puzzles - I like to solve coding issues.</p>

<p>I find contracting enjoyable as I get to meet a variety of developers - ranging from the enthusiastic newbie through to some of the best .NET developers.  </p>

<p>My path into coding goes BBC Basic -> Spectrum -> Amiga AMOS -> Visual Basic 6 -> Pascal -> Java 1.3+ -> ASP.NET (C# although I will code in VB.NET sometimes since it has some useful facilities like optional parameters for a class' members)</p>

<p>It is even more fun to help others manage to code correctly. Keep reading and learning - developers should never stand still in this field which is consistently fast moving.</p>

<p>I always aim to deliver my best, and appreciate decent feedback.</p>",,2010-02-01 18:29:38.690000+00:00,2018-11-28 09:55:04.030000+00:00,"Doncaster, UK",1134,59,12,211,https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMURl.jpg?s=128&g=1,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrandleoflondon

<p>I have a Bachelor of Mathematics. I wrote graduation thesis for Cantor Set.
When I""ýýýýýý"", ""ýýýýýýýýý stuff here, I think it is philosophically interesting(Ontology?).
I like computer programming(Python, Java and so on) and am interested in Philosophy, especially in Free Will, Philosophy of Time and Logic. I used to play guitar a lot, traveling(Australia, South America) and working abroad there.I like music, almost any music.</p>

  Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go
  when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you
  planted, you're there. It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long
  as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into
  something that's like you after you take your hands away. The
  difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is
  in the touching. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have
  been there at all.""</p>

928952,Danielson,"<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm a programmer and an AI researcher. At work I am creating reasoning algorithms to extract information from raw data (like empirical test, brains) and transfer these to decision rules, or other classification methods. The algorithms I've researched, and developed, are being 'grouped' in a single ""organismic"" reasoning entity.
Thereafter I focused on bioinformatics to create a network of information on the working of the human system.
In free time, I'm creating an Android interface for a NewsApp.</p>

Working in small companies is amazing if you are a lifetime learner like me. Everyday, I learn something new that I have not known for last 5 years. I just love my job.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working a project manager in a technology provider company. I've great expectations of this company as we're building it up from scratch and we've a good/solid/experienced/workaholic/disciplined team. </p>

<p>I've developed electronic boards (mostly micro-controller based stuff), developed client-server software, utilities, programming toolkits, web applications and sites, embedded software, and even a simple programming language to be run on an 8-bit CPU (oh, good old times).</p>

<p>As far as programming languages go;</p>

<p>I'm experienced in :
  c, .net, Delphi, Basic, AVR assembly, Z80 assembly (hey you can even throw machine code, believe me, I've written in machine code too!)</p>

<p>I'm somewhat experienced (as to debug an existing project or develop a new project if I'm not in a hurry and have a good internet connection) in :</p>

<p>Visual Basic, x86 Assembly (mostly up to 386 architecture), Java, PIC assembly</p>

<p>I've worked with (I can debug an existing code, or make small changes etc):
  numerious 4GLs including (Natural, clipper, foxpro, powerbuilder, etc)</p>

<p>As for SQL, I'm very experienced in T-SQL, mid-level in PL/SQL, and developed SPs in c for DB2</p>

<p>And on a highly related note, as far as RDBMSes go,</p>

<p>I'm very experienced in MSSQL, mid-level in Oracle and DB2, at best a novice in MYSQL.</p>

<p>I've experience in server programming (sockets, WCF, Web services, RPC, named-pipes,you name it), client-side programming, stand-alone apps, utilities, embedded systems software.</p>

<p>I've experience in developing APIs, programming toolkits and libraries in several platforms. (developing for programmers and developing for users are two completely different things) </p>",,2012-01-01 07:59:54.940000+00:00,2016-05-02 18:34:31.283000+00:00,,619,2,0,17,,http://gokkor.blogspot.com/

5712506,AlphaKevy,"<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>What do I like to do?  hmmmm, well, I like to find creative solutions.  In my work and school I'm often challeneged with coming up with new ideas on how to deal with problems, and I love sitting down and creating something.  Stackoverflow is a wonderful community, and I'm constantly learning.</p>

<p>Besides computer stuff, I'm an avid runner and am training up to my first big race in August (125km ultramarathon), so that consumes most of my time.  If you ever want to talk about running or sports, shoot me a message :D</p>

<p>Other than that, I have no professional coding experience and have just been learning the tools I need as I go.  If I had to do it again, I would probably take more CS classes in school, but who knows where I would have ended up.  I currently work in Wildfire Science and get to help people around the province.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my bio, and if you answer any of my questions, a big THANKS goes out to you.</p>

<p>Cheers,
K</p>",,2015-12-23 20:23:23.873000+00:00,2018-11-19 06:27:54.240000+00:00,"Edmonton, AB, Canada",83,16,0,23,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93977cba096188b080ea40470bd08373?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,

<p>I'm currently a freelance developer for <a href=""http://github.com/twentypeople"" rel=""nofollow"">TwentyPeople Europe</a> but I mostly spend my time on self-lead projects. My most important projects so far have been the <a href=""https://github.com/unrar/unbot"" rel=""nofollow"">unbot IRC bot</a>, now deprecated, and the <a href=""https://github.com/unrar/rmvc"" rel=""nofollow"">RMVC framework</a> which provides an easy way to use the MVC structure in any kind of Ruby application (quite like <em>Ruby without Rack</em>).</p>

<p>There's a <em>Python vs Ruby</em> war inside me, which doesn't seem to ever stop, that's why 1/3 my projects are Ruby-written, another third are Python written and the remaining third are C#, C++ or Java written.</p>

<p>I've been away from the Ubuntu/Linux community for a while because of personal issues, but I'm back. My <em>catbuntu.me</em> domain expired, and I'm not likely to re-buy it, so I'm hosting <a href=""https://unrar.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">my blog</a> in GitHub at the moment. If you want to contact me, ask me for my new email. :-)</p>

<p>I'm currently in pre-med school, working hard on that biochemistry, math and physics. Ubuntu assists my studies! (see: <a href=""https://github.com/unrar/phyhelper"" rel=""nofollow"">my attempt of a physics python app</a>)</p>

<p>You can find me in Freenode as <strong>unrar</strong> or <strong>Catbuntu</strong>, in TripSit as <strong>isomer</strong> and in reddit as <a href=""http://reddit.com/u/joszaynka"" rel=""nofollow"">joszaynka</a>.

<p>Digital media has always been a major passion of mine. When I was 10 years old I learned to program in a language called Qbasic. I was hooked! The rest of my youth was spent making websites, video games, graphics, movies, and music.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple decades later and I find myself in the beautiful Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. My wife and I moved here in 2016 to pursue our dream to build an off-grid, permaculture homestead. It has been the most difficult challenge I've ever attempted but also the most rewarding. We've been documenting the journey online and <a href=""http://www.ozarkpermaculture.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">invite you to follow along</a>.</p>

<p>I take pride in my work and push myself to the limit. As your colleague I will bring that experience, dedication and work ethic to the table, to deliver quality work and leave the company better than I found it. So what do you say? <a href=""http://www.nealgist.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Let's get in touch and build something awesome together</a>!</p>",,2012-05-04 18:53:52.207000+00:00,2018-11-09 20:35:59.083000+00:00,"Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, USA",581,4,0,61,https://i.stack.imgur.com/h1Qaf.jpg,http://www.nealgist.com

4768873,Rob Baily,"<p>I have always loved computer programming.  First using terminals and PET computers (640K RAM and cassette tapes for storage) back in elementary school then moving up to Atari 800 where I did my first programming in basic.  I love it because to me it is like a puzzle to solve but one that can be shaped and formed by my own doing.  I've been doing it for over 30 years now with some breaks into management but never losing that desire to get in and tinker.</p>

<p>Really enjoying learning new things now like Spring Boot, Mongo DB, C++ 11 (ok so I was out of C++ for a while).</p>

<p>Also love to play volleyball.

382149,Steve McDuff,"<p>It was on a cold day of autumn that I started learning C++. I never felt quite the same afterward. Gone were the days of patching the loose threads of visual basic. Suddenly, I didn't feel like I was wearing the oven mitts of batch files syntax. Those days were great, men were real men, women real women and memory was allocated where it needed be.</p>

<p>Those memories were short lived. The almighty need for exchange of currencies demanded Java. Oh the horror. Why, oh, why does it take 30mb of RAM for the world to see my greetings. Grieving passed and days became bright again. At last, a standard library that works. I erected a field of SEP on the collectors of orphaned objects. Ideas flowed faster than ever before in this canvas dot java. An army of ants armed with readability spread out to assemble my creations.</p>

<p>Yet, a desire remained. Why could a few lines in a spread sheet outdo all the shining design patterns scattered across the tall towers of my architectures. Was there a better world out there? Where a few statements could remain simple and yet reach for the sky, free from the bounds of tables!</p>

<p>Thus, deduced was born. A small child at first. It spoke very few words and couldn't quite run quickly on his feet just yet. But he had the gift of potential. With nurturing and care, let there be no limits he won't overcome.</p>",,2010-07-02 14:48:44.917000+00:00,2018-11-22 15:43:13.447000+00:00,Canada,178,37,2,37,,http://deduced.org

<ul>
<li>The most powerful words are ""I don't know""</li>
<li>Learn as much as you can - be teachable</li>
<li>Give back</li>
<li>When you make a mistake, admit it as quickly as possible and look for a way to avoid repeating it in the future</li>
<li>Realize that you'll never be the best/smartest in any one area, but you <strong>ARE</strong> for the unique combination of talent, skills and experience you possess.</li>
</ul>

<h1>About asking questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Be able to answer: <a href=""http://whathaveyoutried.com"" rel=""nofollow"">""What have you tried?""</a></li>
<li>For better help sooner, post an <a href=""http://sscce.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SSCCE</a> </li>

</ul>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to this random assortment of facts.</p>

<p>I have been developing software for a long time. I also manage software projects. I enjoy both the tactical aspect of writing code as well as the strategic aspect of keeping the customer happy, the development team happy and building software that will Do Something Useful.</p>

<h2>Industries I've Worked</h2>

<p>IT is everywhere! Most industries are very similar when it comes to employee needs, although one might think they're very different. I've seen Financial Traders get just as worked up and panicked as Healthcare Staff when their systems aren't working properly. My job is to make it so whatever the user wants to do is <em>EASY</em> and, in effect, so that they don't even notice me.*</p>

<ul>
<li>Business Process Improvement,</li>
<li>Chemical,</li>
<li>Education,</li>
<li>Energy (oil, gas, &amp; electricity),</li>
<li>Entertainment,</li>
<li>Financial,</li>
<li>Healthcare,</li>
<li>Marketing,</li>
<li>Media,</li>
<li>Property Management, and</li>
<li>Software (the company's actual product)

<ul>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Mobile (Android + IOS) App Development</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite OS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mac OSX is my primary (the command line rocks for unleashing the power of bash)</li>
<li>Debian for regular server</li>
<li><strike>Windows</strike> <strike>XBox</strike> PS4 for the games</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preferred Browsers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chrome, hands down</li>
<li>Firefox, if you're nasty</li>
<li>Safari, if I must</li>
<li>IE if you want me to hate my job</li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite Languages</h2>

<p>There isn't really a favorite, just languages that are better suited for a particular task/application. I want to <strong>use the best tool for the job</strong>, because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument"" rel=""nofollow"">not everything is a nail</a>.</p>

2212907,Liquid Core,"<p>Let me learn and you'll have my heart.</p>

<p>Mainly working with C#, ASP.NET MVC, MS SQL Server and Oracle.
I've got my hand pretty dirty with:
ASP.NET, ASP, VB.NET, VB, Microsoft SQL server, Oracle/PL-SQL, MySql, WindowsCE, MSQLce, Actionscript, Flex, HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery, BootStrap, AngularJS, MongoDB, MoonGoose, Node.JS, AutoIT for various reasons, which goes to codebase refresh, porting of existing code and other various activities.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm learning linux and fiddling with security (kali, backtrack, etc...) because it was something I had any previous experence with.</p>

<p>Had my fun with a lot of customer assistance (technical and not) on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, BlackBerry) both on mobile and non-mobile platforms.</p>

<p>Have been taught the hard way system administration for windows platform, both in software architecture (managing server, AD, SQL Server DBA, Installing/recovering OS and so on) and hardware (Cisco mainly, but I've put my hands on a lot of different brands of NAS, Switches, APs, routers and so on) and more particular hardware (Motorola and other Barcode readers, Zebra/Toshiba label printers, serial/ethernet converters, arduino/raspberry), while being the ""computer guy"" for a big manifacturing company which needed to bring up heavy informatization on its manifacturing process. This task covered everything from the basic user assistance and teaching from solving server problems and developing their IT system (software, hardware).</p>

<p>At the moment I am currently in a career switch to expand my skills to a workplace where I'm using
Xamarin, Asp.NET Core, ASP .NET MVC, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies projects and covering also a Project Management role. </p>

<p>Speaking english, spanish, french and italian.</p>

<p>I have a genuine love for retrogaming and all the roundabouts. I remember spending ton of coins in old arcades in the 90s and beginning of 2000 before they started slowly to die :(</p>

<p>Loving also all old FPS goodies like Duke Nukem, Quake, Doom, Hexen and everything around it.</p>

<p>It was and still is an awesome time in my life.</p>

<p>Love mostly everything about programming. There is so much to learn and so little time, DUH!</p>",,2013-03-26 18:33:03.167000+00:00,2018-11-26 01:25:14.140000+00:00,Italy,1855,105,46,423,https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzYRt.jpg?s=128&g=1,

<p>In June 2015 I've founded a software house called <strong>Background</strong> and the main project is a medical ERP java based (I'm using <strong>Struts2</strong>, <strong>Spring</strong> and <strong>Hibernate</strong> with a <strong>MySQL</strong> database), but we love technology so we offer also many other services, like a <strong>PHP</strong> CMS (developed all by myself) written using <strong>Laravel</strong> framework.</p>

<p>In the free time... Well in the free time I use to code... a lot...<br/>
...and make love with my girlfriend... a lot too!</p>

<p>By day, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m a senior software engineer at a firm in northern Virginia, and by night Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m an electronics hobbyist. Ah yes, solder fumes and the whirl of my laptopï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fan - what a great pastime. I like to keep my hands busy, and when theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re not youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll find me outside hiking, canoeing, kayaking or biking.</p>
