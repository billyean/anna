8041931,"<p>On Stack Exchange, we believe the core moderators should come <em>from</em> the community, and be elected by the community itself through popular vote. We hold regular elections to determine who these community moderators will be.</p>

<p>Community moderators are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/"">accorded the highest level of privilege on our community</a>, and should themselves be exemplars of positive behavior and leaders within the community.</p>

<p>Our general criteria for moderators are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>patient and fair</li>
<li>leads by example</li>
<li>shows respect for their fellow community members in their actions and words</li>
<li>open to some light but firm moderation to keep the community on track and resolve (hopefully) uncommon disputes and exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>For the Stack Overflow election, an eligible candidate <b>must</b> have all of the following badges:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/badges/32/civic-duty"">Civic Duty</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/badges/12/strunk-white"">Strunk &amp; White</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/badges/1002/deputy"">Deputy</a></li>

<p>Due to the size of Stack Overflow (averaging nearly 2,000 flags per day!), moderation can be <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/287878/should-stack-overflow-moderators-have-a-standard-of-duty"">a significant responsibility</a> - if you can't dedicate <em>at least</em> 30 minutes each day to help shoulder the load, please defer to those who can.</p>

<p>Every election has three phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nomination</li>
<li>Primary</li>
<li>Election</li>
</ol>

<p>Please participate in the moderator elections by voting, and perhaps even by nominating yourself to be a community moderator!</p>
